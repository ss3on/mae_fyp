      "1 Introduction The goal of this investigation is to determine the exact point accessibility of robotic manipulators. This information is useful for engineers to optimally posit robot cells and to adequately plan robot trajectories. The point accessibility of a robot to an operating point is defined as the set of all directions from there the point is accessible by the robots end-effector. This set of directions, as the accessibility regions, constructed on the service sphere of the point. The service sphere  1,2  of an operating point is the sphere centered at the point with the radius the length of the robots hand size. wrist design encountered limits of joint rotation. Yang et al.  8  introduced a method of disassembling the manipulator into the regional and wrist structures for determining if a point is accessible from a particular direction. Emiris and Tourassis  17  and Basavaraj and Duffy  18  derived measures which indicate the percentage of directions from which a point can be accessed. Recently, Abdel-Malek  2  worked on the optimal locality problem of manipulator arms. In the approach, initial boundary points of the wrist workspaces are first found as seeds based on the method introduced by Huag et al.  9  . In turn, a numerical perturbation technique is used to trace out the boundaries of the entire wrist workspace. However, in the paper, no examples with the exact shape of the accessibility regions have been provided. Besides, the practical issue of having possible rotational limits on wrist joints has not been considered. In this paper, we take a geometric approach that is different from existing ones. As a result, we believe, for the first time, the exact point accessibility regions of a 6-DOF manipulator imposed with practical joint limits are revealed. Our method of determining accessibility involves deriving constraint equations, which define curves on the surface of the service sphere. Accessibility boundaries will arise from both the regional structure and the wrist structure. The uniqueness of the solution of the constraint equations is guaranteed by a reasonable assumption that the regional structure is much larger than the wrist structure. In this case, the relatively small service sphere will have only one intersection region with the wrist boundary. Roth  3  determined that the reachable workspace of a general manipulator was bounded by the surface of a generalized torus. Gupta and Roth  4  extended this approach by considering n degree-of-freedom manipulators. Kumar and Waldron  5  introduced the concept of dexterous workspace. The dexterous workspace was determined to be contained within the wrist workspace, reduced in size by the length of the end effector. This subject was further studied by Vijay et al.  6  , Lai and Menq  7  , and Yang et al.  8  . Later Huag et al.  9  and Yang and Huag  10  analytically formulated the manipulator workspace boundary problems by using the manipulator kinematic constraint equations and their Jacobian matrices. Examples were provided for planar Stewart platform and planar 4-bar manipulators. Based on this concept, Yeh and Abdel-Malek  11  obtained the analytical workspace boundary for general 3-DOF mechanisms. of The ability to solve the constraint equations and to plot the accessibility boundary curves depends on the adequate selection of the coordinate systems. A designated coordinate system is defined for the derivation of each constraint equations. This coordinate system is referred to as the neutral coordinate system. The importance of the selection of neutral coordinate systems is to ensure a rapid reach of unambiguous solutions during the numerical process. These neutral coordinate frames can be easily selected as described in the next section. 2 Description of the Method The concept of dexterous versus reachable workspace indicates that not all reachable points can be accessed from every direction, but does not provide information about the accessibility of nondexterous points. In light of this, the issue of comparing different manipulators has been considered by deriving measures dexterity. Yang and Lai  1  introduced the concept of service angle, which is a region on the service sphere defining the directions from which the point of interest can be accessed. Yoshikawa  12  and Park and Brockett  13  considered dexterity with respect to trajectory planning and dynamics. Yang and Chiueh  14  addressed the accessibility issue on specified workplanes.  15  and Trabia and Davidson  16  reported on spherical robot Contributed by the Mechanisms Committee for publication in the J OURNAL OF M ECHANICAL D ESIGN . Manuscript received Jun. 1997. Associate Technical Editor: V. Kumar. Gupta Figure 1 shows the service sphere constructed for the point p . The service sphere intersects the wrist workspace boundary surface. The curve of intersection is denoted as the accessibility boundary on the service sphere. Since the wrist workspace boundary is made up of several subsurface types, a constraint equation Fig. 1 Service sphere intersecting a wrist workspace boundary surface Fig. 3 Specially selected neutral coordinate system that the zn axis will pass through the accessibility boundary curve. For the wrist structure constraint equations, the xn y n zn frame is also chosen such that the zn axis passes through accessibility boundary curve. will be derived for each of these types. In this figure, o is the base, e is the elbow, and w is the wrist of the manipulator. Since the accessibility boundary curves for each of the constraints is with respect to a different xn y n zn frame, the Cartesian coordinates of the curves are transformed to a common coordinate system for plotting. The common coordinate system is named the xc y c zc frame. This frame is centered at the point of interest and has its axes parallel to the x 0 y 0 z 0 frame, the base frame. The accessibility region for the point will be that region which satisfies all of the constraints. 3 Kinematics The constraint equations will be in the form f ( f , c ) 5 0 where f and c are the spherical coordinate angles of the wrist with respect to the specially selected neutral coordinate systems. Figure 3 shows the accessibility boundary curve on the service sphere for the point p , and the neutral coordinate system designated as the xn y n zn frame. Figure 2 illustrates the contribution of the u 4 wrist joint limit on the accessibility. The vector n eow is the normal to the plane of the regional structure of the manipulator which contains the points o , e , and w . The vector n epw is the normal to the plane containing both the last link of the regional structure and the last link of the wrist structure, and contains the points e , p , and w . By holding the u 4 joint fixed at its limit, the angle between these two planes must be constant as the other joints of the manipulator are varied. From this property, the constraint equation corresponding to joint 4 can be generated by computing the cross product between the two normal vectors n epw and n eow . The constraint equation for the u 5 joint limit is derived similarly by evaluating the cross product between two other vectors, one from e to w and the other from p to w . Since limitations on the u 6 joint do not affect the approach direction accessibility, it is assumed that u 6 is unlimited. Each of the constraint equations will be in terms of the spherical coordinate angles f and c , but these angles will be with respect to different xn y n zn coordinate systems. For the regional structure constraint equations, the zn axis of the xn y n zn frame is chosen to be along the common normal between the service sphere and the wrist workspace boundary surface. This guarantees 3.1 Manipulator Parameters. The notation commonly used to describe a robotic manipulator was introduced by Denavit and Hartenberg  19  . Four Denavit-Hartenberg parameters are used to describe the location of a reference frame attached to a given link with respect to the reference frame attached to the previous link. The parameters are defined as follows: u i 5 rotation angle from rotating xi 2 1 into xi about zi 2 1 , di 5 axial offset between xi 2 1 and xi along zi 2 1 , ai 5 common normal between zi 2 1 and zi along xi , and a i 5 twist angle from rotating zi 2 1 into zi about xi . Successive reference frames are attached to each link starting at frame x 0 y 0 z 0 at the base of the manipulator. The reference frames for the articulated manipulator considered here are shown in Fig. 4. Numerical values for the Denavit-Hartenberg parameters and joint limits are arbitrarily selected for the example and are listed in Tables 1 and 2. The values used for the non-zero Fig. 2 Accessibility region on service sphere due to u 4 limit Fig. 4 Reference frames for articulated manipulator Table 1 Denavit-Hartenberg parameters for articulated manipulator  i  1  2  3  4  5  6    u i d i a i a i  u 1 0 0 1 p 2  u 2 0 a 2 0  u 3 0 0 1 p 2  u 4 d 4 0 2 p 2  u 5 0 0 1 p 2  u 6 d 6 0 0  Table 2 Joint limits for articulated manipulator  limit  u 1  u 2  u 3  u 4  u 5  u 6    lower upper  2 120 1 120  2 30 1 120  2 60 1 240  2 150 1 150  2 150 1 150  unlimited unlimited  linear parameters are a 2 5 1.0, d 4 5 0.5, and d 6 5 0.25. The length of the end effector, d 6 , is defined as the hand length, h . 3.2 Homogeneous Transformation. Homogeneous transformations are used to represent both coordinate frames and the transformations among frames. The transformations are derived by a series of rotations or translations. The notation Rot  axis, a and Trans( x , y , z ) is used to describe the derivation of each transformation. The term Rot  axis, a represents a rotation about an axis by an angle a . Each of the constraint equations is derived in terms of the spherical coordinate angles f and c which are with respect to the xn y n zn frame. The Cartesian coordinates of the wrist with respect to the xn y n zn frame are Fig. 5 Sections of workspace boundary surfaces 4 Constraint Equations-Regional Structure Joint Limits well The objective here is to derive a constraint equation for each of the wrist workspace boundary surface types which, when satisfied, determine curves on the surface of the service sphere. A different xn y n zn coordinate system will be used for deriving each of the wrist workspace boundary type constraint equations. In all cases, the coordinates of the wrist with respect to the x 0 y 0 z 0 frame are needed and computed by: where n w is defined in Eq.  1  , and  0 T n  is the transformation from the x 0 y 0 z 0 frame to the xn y n zn frame. 3.3 Manipulator Workspaces. The workspaces for different manipulators have been studied extensively and are known  3  . The type of manipulator considered here is a simple articulated manipulator with an Euler angle wrist. As shown in Fig. 5, this exercise results in the construction of three workspace surfaces: the reachable workspace, the wrist workspace, and the dexterous workspace. The reachable workspace surface contains all of the points which the tool tip p can reach. The wrist workspace contains all of the points which w can reach. Figures 5  a  and 5  b  are sections of the workspaces through the x 0 z 0 and x 0 y 0 planes respectively. - upper 4.1 Wrist Workspace Plane Boundary. The xn y n zn coordinate system for the wrist workspace plane boundary constraint equation is selected to have its z axis normal to a wrist workspace plane boundary, as shown in Fig. 6. The transformation  0 T n  from the x 0 y 0 z 0 frame to the xn y n zn frame is computed by one translation and two rotations to be The angle u 1 will be equal to either u 1 u or u 11 , the upper and lower limits of u 1 , respectively, corresponding to the upper plane and lower planes shown in Fig. 5  b  . The constraint equation for this wrist workspace boundary type is derived by recalling the general equation for a plane, which is 3.4 Construction of Wrist Workspace. The wrist workspace is used in this paper for determining accessibility and is comprised of several subsurface types. The terms upper and lower are used to represent surfaces corresponding to the upper end lower joint limits, respectively. The curve labeled sphere in Fig. 5  a  is generated by the wrist w when links a 2 and d 4 are aligned and u 2 is varied. Likewise, the lower sphere curve is generated with u 3 held at its limits and varying u 2 . It is assumed that the upper and lower limits of u 3 are such that the angle between a 2 and d 4 is the same for both limits of u 3 . The lower torus curve is swept out by holding u 2 at its lower limit and varying u 3 . The upper torus curve is generated similarly. These curves generate surfaces when they are revolved around the z 0 axis by varying u 1 . The construction of the wrist workspace is completed by considering the limits of u 1 as shown in Fig. 5  b  . In this case, the limits on u 1 create two planar surfaces, denoted as the upper plane and lower plane, due to the upper and lower limits of u 1 respectively. Fig. 6 Service sphere intersecting wrist workspace plane boundary surface Fig. 8 Service sphere intersecting wrist workspace sphere boundary surface By selecting three points, which are in the plane, the constants a , b , c , and d can be determined. The constraint equation in this case is where, fp ( f , c ) denotes the constraint equation for a planar wrist workspace boundary. 4.2 Wrist Workspace Torus Boundary. The xn y n zn frame for the wrist workspace torus boundary constraint equation has its z -axis passing through the point t and the point p , as shown in Fig. 7. The point t is on the centerline of the torus and in the plane containing both the point p and the z 0 axis. The tranformation  0 T n  from the x 0 y 0 z 0 frame to the xn y n zn frame is computed by two rotations, a translation, and a third rotation to be where a is the radius of the centerline of the torus, b is the radius of the generating circle, c is the z offset, and x , y , and z are the coordinates of a point on the surface of the torus. The values for a , b , and c are The angle g 1 is a function in terms of u 2 , and expressions of f p , c p , and g 1 , can be formulated geometrically according to Fig. 7  20  . where u 2 is equal to either u 2 u or u 2 l , the upper and lower limits of u 2 , respectively, for the upper torus or lower torus wrist workspace boundary surfaces shown in Fig. 5  a  . Substituting the coordinates of the wrist with respect to the x 0 y 0 z 0 frame and the values for a , b , and c into this equation, the constraint equation becomes The constraint equation for this wrist workspace boundary type is derived by recalling that the equation of a torus  21  centered about the z -axis and offset from the xy plane is where, f t ( f , c ) designates the constraint equation for boundary. a torus Fig. 7 Service sphere intersecting wrist workspace torus boundary surface 4.3 Wrist Workspace Sphere Boundary. The xn y n zn coordinate system for the wrist workspace sphere boundary constraint equation has its z -axis in the direction from the origin of the x 0 y 0 z 0 frame toward the point p , as shown in Fig. 8. The transformation  0 T n  is computed by two rotations and one translation to be where the angles f p and c p , and the distance p can be formulated geometrically according to Fig. 8  20  . The constraint equation for this wrist workspace boundary type is derived by recalling the equation of a sphere centered at the origin, which is where, x , y , and z are the coordinates of a point on the surface of the sphere, and r is the radius of the sphere. The wrist workspace sphere boundary is centered at the origin of the x 0 y 0 z 0 frame. The radius r of the wrist workspace sphere boundary will be one of the two values for the upper sphere and the lower sphere, respectively. The coordinates of the wrist with respect to the x 0 y 0 z 0 frame must satisfy Eq.  11  for the wrist to be on the wrist workspace boundary surface. After substituting the coordinates of the wrist with respect to the x 0 y 0 z 0 frame and some algebraic manipulation, the constraint equation becomes With u 4 to be held fixed at its limit, the angle between the normal vectors of the planes containing the triangles epw and eow , n epw and n eow respectively, must be constant as the other joints of the manipulator are varied. The constraint equation is generated by computing the cross product between the normals using the relationship where f s ( f , c ) designates the constraint equation for a spherical boundary. where the angle between the normals is p 2 u 4 , and u 4 is either u 4 u or u 41 for the upper and lower limits, respectively. Carrying out the cross product, the constraint equation becomes 5 Constraint Equations-Wrist Structure Joint Limits The objective here is to define curves on the surface of the service sphere which bound the accessibility region with respect to the wrist joint in question. In this case, the wrist joint will be held fixed at its limit, and the other joints of the manipulator will be varied resulting in the accessibility boundary curve traced on the surface of the service sphere. The constraint equations are derived for joints u 4 and u 5 . where f 4( f , c ) denotes the constraint equation for a limit on u 4 , and the values of ex , ey , ez , g 3 , g 4 , g 5 , and g 6 can all be found geometrically according to Fig. 9  20  . As with the regional structure constraints, the first task is to select the neutral coordinate system, the xn y n zn frame. The coordinates of the wrist with respect to the xp y p zp frame are needed and computed by where n w is defined in Eq.  1  . The transformation  0 T p  from the x 0 y 0 z 0 frame to the xp y p zp frame is needed for plotting the accessibility boundary curves, and is identical to the transformation  0 T n  computed in Eq.  10  . The coordinates of the wrist with respect to the x 0 y 0 z 0 frame are computed by Equation  19  is used to generate four accessibility curves on the surface of the service sphere. The four curves result from considering the upper and lower limits of u 4 for both the elbow up and elbow down configurations of the manipulator. 5.2 Limit on u 4 Wrist Joint. The xn y n zn frame is located with respect to the xp y p zp frame as shown in Fig. 9. The figure shows the manipulator with u 4 held fixed at its upper limit. The xn axis passes through the points g and p in the direction from g to p . The point g is where the elbow e of the manipulator would be when all of the links of the manipulator are in the xp z p plane, and a 2 and d 4 are aligned as shown in the figure. This is the neutral position of the manipulator. The transformation  p T n  is computed by two rotations to be - 5.2 Limit on u 5 Wrist Joint. As with the previous joint limit, the xn y n zn coordinate system is defined with respect to the xp y p zp frame as shown in Fig. 10. With the elbow in the neutral position, the elbow e would be at the point g . The zn axis passes through the points g and p in the direction from g to p . The transformation  p T n  is computed by one rotation to be The angle g 1 is computed using the law of cosines for the triangle gop , as shown in Fig. 10. where, g 1 is computed using the law of cosines for triangle gop , as shown in Fig. 9, and the angle g 2 is one of the two values where, u 4 u and u 4 l are the upper and lower limits of u 4 , respectively. Fig. 9 Manipulator with u 4 fixed at limit It is assumed here that the upper and lower limits of u 5 are equal. With u 5 held fixed at its limit, the angle between links 3 and 6 of the manipulator must be constant as the other joints of the manipulator are varied. The constraint equation is generated by computing the cross product between the vectors e w and p w using the relationship where e w and p w are the locations of the wrist with respect to the points e and p , respectively. The two vectors e w and p w are defined with respect to xp y p zp frame coordinates. The vector e w is found by Fig. 10 Manipulator with u 5 fixed at limit After carrying out the cross product and some algebraic manipulations, the constraint equation becomes where f 5( f , c ) denotes the constraint equation for a limit on u 5 . Fig. 11 Accessibility region due to wrist workspace constraints for 0 p 1 6 Solving and Plotting the Constraint Equations The accessibility region boundaries on the service sphere are plotted by solving each of the constraint equations. An algorithm has been developed to determine which of the constraint equations to consider for a given point  20  . The algorithm is not included in this paper. The overall accessibility region on the service sphere satisfies all of the constraint equations which need to be considered for the given point. To illustrate the accessibility region due to all three types of wrist workspace boundary types, the point 0 p 1 is selected, where The accessibility region due to the lower plane wrist workspace boundary for the point 0 p 2 is shaded in Fig. 12. The accessibility region due to the u 4 wrist joint constraint for the point 0 p 2 is shaded in Fig. 13. For the case of the u 5 wrist joint constraint, if the point is accessible with elbow up, it may only be partially accessible with elbow down, and vice versa. The accessibility boundary on the service sphere due to this partial accessibility is found using the torus constraint equation. Figure 14 illustrates this situation. The overall accessibility of this point is found by combining the accessibility regions of Figs. 12, 13, and 14. The overall accessibility region for the point 0 p 2 s shaded in Fig. 15. The accessibility region, shaded in Fig. 11, is the region on the service sphere which satisfies all three of the wrist workspace boundary constraint equations. The wrist joint constraints are not shown for this point so that the effect of the wrist workspace boundary surface constraints can be clearly seen. To illustrate the effect of the wrist joint limit constraints and one of the wrist workspace boundary constraints, the point 0 p 2 is selected, where Fig. 12 Accessibility region due lower plane constraint for 0 p 2 Fig. 13 Accessibility region due to u 4 wrist joint limit for 0 p 2 Fig. 14 Accessibility region due to u 5 wrist joint limit for 0 p 2 Fig. 15 Overall accessibility for 0 p 2\n",

Box 22970, Rochester, New York 14692-2970 e-mail: www.gleason.com The Ultimate Motion Graph The innovation was to develop a gear geometry that reduces or eliminates gear noise and increases the strength of gears. Gear noise is a common problem in all bevel and hypoid gear drives. A variety of expensive gear geometry optimizations are applied daily in all hypoid gear manufacturing plants, to reduce gear noise. In many cases those efforts have little success. Additional expensive finishing operations (lapping after the grinding) ar applied to achieve the goal of quiet and stong gear sets. The ultimate motion graph is a concept for modulating the tooth surfaces that uses a physical effect to cancel out the dynamic disturbances that are naturally generated by all up-to-date known kind of gears. The ultimate motion graph also eliminates the sensitivity of gears against deflection under load or displacements because of manufacturing tolerances. Lower dynamic disturbances will also increase the dynamic strength.  S1050-0472  00  00203-8  Keywords: Bevel Gears, Hypoid Gears, Motion Graph, Noise Reduction, Bevel Gear Grinding, Ease-off, Adjustability Design Practice Today According to classic design, gearsets have three principal types of tooth contact pattern. The type of tooth contact depends to the highest degree on the possible flank form modifications versus the conjugate flank form. can cross many contact lines as shown in Fig. 1, or it might be identical to one contact line. It can  but does not have to  be identical to the path of contact  see also  2  . The second element to generate crowning is a profile modification on the tool. A concave curvature on the cutting edge of a blade  versus a straight edge  will take stock off on top and flank and cause a circular profile crowning. Figure 2 presents a profile crowning that results in a high bias contact if it is the only or the dominating correction. The third element of flank crowning is a flank twist from toe to heel. Figure 3 shows the classic flank twist. The most commonly used methods to obtain an Ease-Off as shown in Fig. 3 is a cutter tilt around the root angle axis and a corresponding change of the machine root angle. Other methods are the use of modified roll and helical motion  1  . All real bevel and hypoid gear application used in power transmissions  and many cylindrical gears  use a combination of all three types of crowning. The intent of flank modifications is to provide a limited contact area under no load or light load which provides insensitivity to gear housing tolerances, inaccuracies in the gear members and assembly, as well as deflections. The corrections keep the contact pattern inside the boundaries of the teeth and, therefore, prevent edge contact. For cutting bevel gears there are three mechanisms to create modifications that have the intent to locate the bearing contact. Those modifications are called crowning. In case of face milling, there is no basic machine set-up that provides conjugate flank geometry. Cutting in the root line plane and rolling in a plane that matches the pitch line can only be approximated for gears with a tapered tooth depth. The elements of flank form correction are used in the gear design of tapered depth tooth systems to eliminate the systematic deviations from conjugate to some extent and leave a desired crowning characteristic. Principally, this leads to similar flank corrections that were once applied to face hobbed gearsets with a uniform tooth depth design. The first element is lengthwise crowning which is a circular modification along the face width. If a ring gear is cut to the conjugate theory and a circular modification is applied to the pinion the result of the interaction between pinion and gear after cutting is shown in Fig. 1. Length crowning can be generated by modifying the cutter radius vs. the theoretical conjugate radius. For example, by reducing the length radius on a convex flank, clearance will be provided towards the heel or toe end of the tooth. Similarly, length crowning can be generated by tilting the face cutter head around the flank line tangent and by a corresponding change of the blade angles. The so-called Ease-Off represents the interaction between pinion and gear roll position by roll position, across the whole flank surface. Pinion and gear are rotated from contact line to contact line about discrete angles with respect to their ratio. If we visualize this process, it becomes clear that a contact between the two mating flanks exists only in theoretical conjugate points. If no crowning were applied to the case shown in Fig. 1, the Ease-Off topography would be a flat surface on top of the presentation plane with zero deviation in the ordinate direction  1  . The Ease-Off presentation plane is an axial projection of the gear tooth like the outline of the gear tooth in a crosssectional, two-dimensional blue print. In case of crowning, generally only one point or one line will remain, where the Ease-Off topography is zero. If it is one point, then this location is called the mean point. The mean point is the only location inside the entire flank area where the ratio is accurate and no acceleration or deceleration occurs; it is a conjugate point. In case of a contact in line between Ease-Off and presentation plane, this line is called mean line.

Tooth Contact Motion Graph Fig. 1 Ease-Off with lengthwise crowning Fig. 2 Ease-Off with profile crowning Tooth Contact Motion Graph Fig. 3 Flank twist with bias out contact Research Project to Develop Tooth Contact and Single Flank Characteristics for Quiet Rolling Gearsets The subject of a research project conducted at The Gleason Works was the development of a ground rear axle drive that has a noise characteristic similar to a very high quality lapped gearset. The selected vehicle is one of the most sensitive passenger cars available. It has a rigid beam-style axle mounted basically without any isolation directly to the chassis. The one-piece propeller shaft transmits any kind of stimulation towards the front part of the cabin. Grinding developments done in the past for this vehicle never succeeded. In order to analyze the noise characteristic of the vehicle, airborne noise measurement instruments, speed pick-up as well as pressure gages to determine the exact load situation, were installed in the vehicle. The principle of a laboratory and vehicle measurement loop was successfully applied in the past for grinding developments used in independent and isolated rear axles of expensive luxury vehicles. This closed loop system is shown in Fig. 4. Fig. 4 Closed loop between tester and vehicle measurements grinding process compared to the conventional lapping process. The heat-treat deflections, which are very difficult to control, basically do not have any influence on the final ground flank form. The parts do not need to be stored and built in pairs anymore, which reduces logistical effort and cost. The ground flank form is very easy to control and also repeatable. When the process is developed once, the duplication of the job is almost only a matter of recalling the stored machine settings on the CNC-Controller. The development steps from lot to lot can be either eliminated completely or kept to a minimum. Surface studies on lapped gearsets showed that the lapping grain is attached to the actual flank, which means a continuous light lapping takes place at all times when the gearset is in operation. Furthermore, the lapping grain gets from the surface into the oil and amplifies the negative effect even more. Strength studies have proven a higher allowable bending stress of ground compared to lapped gearsets. The grinding of the edge radii in the root reduces the stress concentration tremendously. The lifeline of the ground gearsets regarding strength can be increased by a factor of 2 or even more. The environmental aspect declares the grinding process as the much cleaner process. The application of modern filter techniques keeps the waste product at a very low level. bending All the above-described benefits combined with good rolling and adjustability characteristics could make the grinding a very competitive process with increasing potential for the near future. The following chapters describe the optimization of crowning and motion transmission on the example of the selected vehicle and ground hypoid gearsets. The Physics of 1st Harmonic Noise The same technique was applied during the actual project to the most challenging conditions of the mentioned midsize sedan. The design for the gears was done by using the Universal Motion Concept  UMC  on the pinion. Higher order kinematic freedoms up to the 4th order were applied to achieve the best possible result in noise, sensitivity and adjustability. The grinding of the actual parts took place on a UMC capable free form grinding machine. During the development phase, highly accurate single flank and structure borne noise test equipment was used to prequalify the gearsets and to establish a correlation between vehicle and test machine. There are several reasons to prefer an advanced research The conflict associated with crowning is the motion error caused by non-conjugate members. If gearbox tolerances and shaft as well as bearing deflections were zero very little crowning would be needed to account for the tooth deflections under load. The small value of motion error would be appreciated for smooth and quiet roll behavior. With realistic part accuracy and deflections, a crowning of 0.1 mm or more may be required. The high motion error will prevent a smooth rolling but also protect from damages by edge contact. Practically all real motion errors have a parabolic shape caused by the parabolic crowning element. Figure 5 discloses angles, velocities and accelerations during a tooth mesh of rolling gear members. The motion graph on top of Fig. 5 is a second order function  see formula plotted over a time axis  . Fig. 7 Kinematic optimization using a fourth order function disturbances will be removed during lapping. Figure 6 shows a parabolic shaped motion graph and its modification by lapping. The motion graph is lapped flat at the top and indicates a sinusoidal or third order modulation at the entrance area. Fig. 5 Relative motion, velocity and acceleration graphs Another possibility of reducing the peak in the acceleration was proposed in the Handbook of Bevel and Hypoid Gears  1  and deals with a fourth order crowning along the Path of Contact. The angular velocity change Dv consequently is the first derivative of the motion graph function which result in dropping first order function  Fig. 5  . The RPM of the driven member is continuously dropping, although the pinion RPM is constant This seems to be impossible but is realistic since the following tooth pair will start again at the high level of Dv  left side of graph  and again drop continuously. In Fig. 7 it is assumed that the motion graph of a tooth pair under load is a horizontal straight line. The motion graph of an undeflected, not loaded pair of teeth needs to pick up the first contact with a horizontal tangent. The disadvantage of this method is the fact that there were no cutting or grinding methods in the past to apply such a correction in a completing environment. Another problem presents the assumption of a horizontally straight motion graph under load. The assumption can be correct under high load but does not apply to the mostly noise critical low load condition. During 80 percent of the duty cycle, the exit area of the load carrying tooth pair will cause a parabola shaped motion characteristic before the changeover occurs to the entrance area of the following pair of teeth. Theoretical Studies and Practical Measurements Higher Order Flank Modifications The second derivative of the motion graph delivers the angular acceleration shown in the lower diagram of Fig. 5. The acceleration is a constant with a negative value. The step in the velocity function is physically defined as an infinitely high acceleration during an infinitely short amount of time. The result is the peak in the acceleration graph on the changeover point between teeth. A short infinite high acceleration is physically an impulse and it reflects the impact each pair of teeth causes at the moment of first contact. of Reduction of Tooth Mesh Impact The result of the gear transmission is an audible noise of the tooth mesh frequency. After the physical discussion in the last paragraph, it seems unavoidable to allow the constant deceleration if a second order crowning was applied to the gearset. The question is what kind of possibilities exist to reduce or eliminate the peak at the beginning of a new tooth mesh One answer to this question is the flank-modification due to lapping. The highest removal of material takes place at the instant of impact because of the peak-torque between the two mating members. In a physically natural way, the material that leads to The laws of physics and mathematics teach that the intersection between a steady monotonic dropping function with a steady monotonic rising function will not have any overlap but just the concrete defined crossing point. Applied to the motion graph this means that left of the intersection point the preceding pair of teeth transmitted torque and speed and to the right of the crossing point the actual teeth are the carrier of motion and load. In other words, a classic gearset with second order crowning elements will always have an effective contact ratio of one  or slightly below  under light load conditions. This conclusion is completely independent from the calculated transverse and face contact ratio. Also, the study in Fig. 7 of a kinamatically optimized motion graph has no potential for more than one pair of teeth in contact at any time during a light load mesh. The motion graph of the lapped gearset  Fig. 6  is not steadily monotonic at the entrance area. Here is a potential for overlap of two following pair of teeth even under zero load. The idea of multiple teeth mesh is not new, but the only solution so far is conjugate tooth contact. Since the conjugate tooth contact will not function under realistic conditions, multiple mesh under no load remained an academic desire and seemed impossible since it appeared to be in conflict with the applicable laws. Fig. 6 Motion graph modification due to lapping The closest approximation to an overlapping contact and a zero motion graph is a contact line crowning only. This correction was proposed by F. Litvin in 1985  3  . Figure 8 shows Ease-Off, tooth contact and motion graph of a pure contact line crowning. The motion error is zero along the bias-in oriented path of contact. At the point where the path of contact exceeds the contact pattern, the Tooth Contact emitted a rough buzzing sound. The FFT result in Fig. 9  bottom  reflects this with a high level of the first harmonic pitch. Total Elimination of Tooth Mesh Impact no The required accuracy to realize the correction of Fig. 8 around the mean point area is in the vicinity of one micron and, therefore, unrealistic for practical applications. The question is, why noise reduction could be achieved compared to conventional parabolic motion error shapes One part of the answer lies in the required accuracy of the flank surfaces and the building in the operation position. The second reason is more a basic problem. The smallest gap between two horizontal, straight motion error lines causes some acceleration peak and also a step in tooth pair stiffness. Motion Graph Fig. 8 Contact line crowning motion graph continues with a parabolic shape. In a mathematical ideal case, it is possible to reduce the impact of a new pair of teeth while entering the meshing process. The tangential transition between two motion graphs can appear to have a gap or an overlap  Fig. 10  . In both cases, an undesirable abrupt change in stiffness of the global system driver-driven will prevent smooth rolling and cause noise. Due to the extremely high accuracy requirement, it most likely will not be possible to avoid even steps between the two straight lines as a result of flank form variations or misalignment between pinion and gear. The requirement of a gearset with no first harmonic frequency vibration can be derived out of the conclusions and statement in the above paragraphs and are listed in the following bullets: - tangential transition of motion graph, - not sensitive to misalignment and flank form tolerances, - no abrupt changes in tooth pair stiffness, - elimination of first and higher order disturbances due to EaseOff and motion graph, - highest possible effective contact ratio under no load and light load, and Practical investigations were conducted to investigate the function of kinematically optimized motion transmission  Fig. 7  and the pure contact line crowning  Fig. 8  . To realize the exotic flank modifications, the Universal Motion Concept was applied to freeform bevel gear grinding machines. The resulting sophisticated gearsets were checked with single flank measurements. The Universal Motion Concept  UMC   4  made it possible to realize the desired contact pattern and motion graph characteristics. - prevention or dissipation of tooth mesh frequency including their higher harmonic multiples. A parameter study covering seven different contact characteristics  such as 4th order kinematic optimized motion graph and contact line crowning  was not successful. In none of the cases it was possible to achieve the low noise level of a good lapped gearset. The measure for noise was the level of the first six harmonic frequencies of the tooth mesh. Those levels were generated by applying a Fast Fourier Transformation  FFT  to a single flank measurement and to the noise recordings of the vehicle test. In Fig. 9, the FFT results of the lapped master gearset and the contact line crowning  Fig. 8  are displayed. In particular with respect to the contact line crowning, the difference between expectations and the measuring result was the most contrary. Even with very light load, just enough to avoid separation at 60 RPM, the gearset Fig. 9 Single flank results, lapped GLYPHlt;132gt; top GLYPHlt;133gt; , contact line crowning GLYPHlt;132gt; bottom GLYPHlt;133gt; The above listed requirements seem to contradict each other although each individual bullet seems a conclusive request for a quiet rolling gearset. The idea of the following discoveries is to combine all listed requirements using dynamic and geometric principles. Figure 11 shows a single flank graph that was designed to realize the discovered solution. At first observation the motion graph in Fig. 11 implies that something is wrong and there is much room for improvement. The motion graph of one pair of teeth mainly consists of a fourth order function. The right maximum could be higher than the left maximum. The relative minimum between the maxima is symmetrically located but might be moved toward the beginning of transmission  left  . The connection between the relative minimum and the maximum to the right is a line with one inflection point. The length of the active portion of the graph  without load  amounts to a small amount less than 2 pitches. After the first impact of the actual pair, a second impact occurs, where the preceding pair takes over the load for 0.38 pitch. The third impact is created again by the actual pair. This is Fig. 10 Different transitions between two straight lines Fig. 11 The Ultimate motion graph Fig. 12 Real contact analysis result of an ultimate motion graph followed by the fourth impact, where the following pair carries out the transmission for 0.40 pitch and finally the fifth impact generated by the last portion of the actual pair of teeth. The many different impacts have different spacing along the time axis. The angular inclination of the tangents  left and right  of the impact point is significantly higher than for conventional shaped motion errors. Overlap as discussed with Fig. 10 is undesirable because of a step in tooth pair stiffness. This is completely prevented under low load conditions in the case of the ultimate motion graph. Development Results and Conclusions During the course of the seven previously mentioned principally different tooth geometries, all theoretically developed machine settings were applied to real pinions, ground on a Phoenix 200HG-UMC capable grinding machine. Coordinate measurement was used to establish a precise flank form. After the flank form development, the gearsets were rolled on a Phoenix tester and analyzed for their single flank characteristic and their vibration emission. Also, pinion cone and offset variations were performed to receive a measure of the sensibility of each development. Instrumented vehicle road tests followed the laboratory tests. The road tests helped to quickly establish a correlation of the vehicle noise to the results of the test machine especially single flank test. Even though the road tests were consequently continued, it was possible in all the following developments to predict the vehicle noise ratings up front very precisely. parabolic 500HCT convert a conventional Ease-Off and Motion graph into the desired, ultimate shape. The comparison to Fig. 11 makes clear that each parabolic shaped conventional motion error  dashed lines  can be converted. The secret of the high contact ratio under no load is to remove the root of the existing parabolas. If the attempt was made to achieve a straight line at the top of the graph  matching the time axis  the gearset might be quiet in one particular build position but would have no adjustability. It also will still have a dominating first harmonic since a change in tooth pair stiffness occurs when a new pair of teeth takes over the transmission  ee also Fig. 10, Case 2  . The 4th-order function that combines the two maxima with the minimum provides the adjustability of a lapped gearset or even better. This also generates in conjunction with the preceding and the following motion graphs five defined impacts instead of one. The strategy here is that the inability of eliminating a mesh impact completely is leading to the conclusion that many small impacts of three different teeth during the mesh of the actual observed tooth would reduce or even dissipate audible noise. This theory is hardened by the fact that the elapsed time between the impacts is different in all five cases. Starting with a high quality lapped gearset, the investigations covered more than twenty different developments. The principally different versions are listed below: - high quality lapped gearset, - rejected lapped gearset, - first UMC ground gearset with borderline rating, - high bias contact with low motion error, - 60 deg bias with contact line crowning with small contact - 60 deg bias with contact line crowning and wide contact - kinematic optimized set with moderate bias, and - the ultimate, newly discovered motion characteristics with moderate bias. the The often-published phrase that there is no exit impulse and, therefore, the motion graph at the exit area needs no attention is not correct. With respect to the fact that the presented proves that the same great attention has to be paid to the exit as is paid to the entrance of a motion graph. The explanation is simple The exit portion of the preceding motion graph leads into the entrance of the actual motion graph. The motion graph of a lapped gearset  Fig. 6  already makes this principally clear. The relationship between exit and entrance area has even been redefined by the 4th-order shape of the ultimate motion graph, since one complete tooth mesh presents five entrance and five exit points. Studying Fig. 12 or Fig. 11 discloses that the tangents on the exit and entrance side  left and right  of one micro impact encloses an angle of more than 135 deg. The ideal obviously would be 180 deg, but conventional parabola shaped graphs enclose an angle below 90 deg  according to the scales used in this paper  . This angle is formed by the exiting end of the preceding and the entering end of the actual graph, which also proves the equal importance of the motion graph characteristic on both ends. The top section of Fig. 13 displays the measurement results of the drive side  pinion concave and gear convex  . The peaks between 1st and 4th mesh frequency have nearly the same magnitudes of 5 to 6 micro-radians. The irregularity of the levels of 5th and higher harmonics is judged to be an advantage in the overall noise emission rating. The bottom section of Fig. 13 shows the coast side measure- Figure 12 shows the real contact analysis result of the Ultimate Motion Graph that finally led to an amazing breakthrough. This method of designing a motion graph was called after its inventors the Stadtfeld-Gaiser Approach. Figure 12 contains the EaseOffs on top and tooth contact as well as motion errors in the mean section and the bottom portion.

It is remarkable how precise the UMC optimization program could motive, truck and aircraft applications. Five automotive manufacturers are in production with more than ten different applications for over one year. Remarkable is the fact that the flank form, required for the ultimate motion graph can be reproduced in an industrial production environment. The produced gearsets are less sensitive to housing tolerances and deflections than conventional gears. Summary Fig. 13 Single flank measurement results of the ultimate motion errors GLYPHlt;132gt; FFT GLYPHlt;133gt; The new flank design is based on a sum of single ideas that build-up on each other. Flank modifications have been done for many years, especially on paper. Most of the theories end up with the statement that no machining equipment is available to realize them. In the presented case, the UMC motions allow achieving nearly any thinkable flank modification. In the case of the discussed research project soft cut and heat-treated pinion and gears were available. After a development step on the computer, using tooth contact analysis, Ease-Off and motion graph as optimization criteria, it was possible to have the new step rolling in a test machine three hours later or even road test it on the same day. Without this short time between ideas and realization, the chain of new features and element could never have been built together to this new concept.\n",

      "1 Introduction Axial-piston swash-plate type hydrostatic pumps and motors are widely used in hydraulic transmissions. Hydraulic transmissions have a unique ability to transmit very large amounts of power using a compact system. die  involved in this process. Due to the complexity of the parts geometry and the shape change during the process, analyzing individual parts separately is infeasible. The area of large deformation plasticity and contact problems has been researched for cold forging and extrusion. Pillinger, Hartley, Sturgess, and Rowe  1  studied an elastic-plastic 3-D FEM using a simple test part and verified the results experimentally. The incremental techniques used in the study were based on the Prandtl-Reuss flow rule and von Mises yield criterion. Thirukkonda, Sirnivasan, and Weiss  2  discussed the plastic instability and flow localization during compressive deformation of a flow softening material using FE simulation. The strains at which the material became unstable were determined depending on the strain-rate sensitivity of the material. Machining defects, mechanical damage, and friction were found to have some effect on the plastic instability of the materials through the development of deformation inhomogeneities. The slipper-piston component, presented in Fig. 1, is an integral component of a hydraulic pump. The piston in Fig. 1 is loosely connected to the slipper to allow the ball head of the piston to move freely in the socket of the slipper. A crimping process is usually used for connecting the slipper and piston components. In the crimping process, a brass slipper socket is crimped onto a steel piston ball using a two-piece die as shown in Fig. 2. During the crimping process, the brass slipper will undergo large plastic deformations to embrace the piston ball. Residual stresses will therefore exist in the material after the crimping process is finished. Liou and Jiang  3  focused their research on stress distributions, especially residual stress distributions, of the forging process. The FEM was used in a study to identify a set of controlling process parameters which can be used for examining the residual stress distribution in forged products. While the previous studies gave good understanding of the processes that were focused on, these methods cannot be applied directly to the analysis of the crimping process. The goal of this study is to create a technique that can be used to analyze the slipper-piston crimping process in both the male-piston and maleslipper design. The results can then be used to optimize this pro- Another design configuration for the piston-slipper component is shown in Fig. 3. In this design, the ball head is part of the slipper. During the connecting process, the piston is deformed to embrace the ball-head of the slipper. The advantage of this design is in moving the forces between the piston and slipper away from the bottom of the slipper. This will significantly increase the stability of the piston in the pump or motor. However, the material used in the piston is steel and unlike brass, which is usually used in the slipper component, steel will have larger stresses during the crimping process. The design shown in Fig. 1 will be referred to as the malepiston model, and the design shown in Fig. 3 will be referred to as the male-slipper model in this study. This paper reports on the application of the Finite Element Method  FEM  to the analysis of the stresses and deformations in the piston-slipper component during and after the crimping process. In order to obtain accurate analysis results, the FEM used has to be able to solve large strain plasticity problems. Large deformation of the slipper makes the linear assumption unsuitable for this analysis. In addition, there are three objects  slipper, piston, and Contributed by the Reliability, Stress Analysis and Failure Prevention Committee for publication in the J OURNAL OF M ECHANICAL D ESIGN .

Gao Fig. 1 The geometry of the piston GLYPHlt;213gt; slipper Fig. 2 The crimping process most widely used iterative procedure for nonlinear problems. The tangent stiffness matrix K T which will be updated in each time step can be expressed as: where t I is the Cauchy stress matrix, D ep is the combined elasticplastic stress-strain matrix, and G is a displacement gradient matrix defined as: where N is the shape function derivatives matrix. The problem encountered in large plastic deformation analysis is the material nonlinearity. For simplicity, the Bilinear Isotropic Hardening model was used to express the stress-strain relationship in this work. Table 1 shows the material properties of the slipper and piston used in this study. The commercial software ANSYS  version 5.3  was used for the FEA calculations. The geometric data used in ANSYS is supplied by the CAD package I-DEAS  Master Series 5  in order to increase the flexibility of the FEA procedure in ANSYS. Whenever the geometric data changed in the analysis, only small modifications are needed in the ANSYS program. Most of the geometric changes were done in I-DEAS which is more powerful than ANSYS in the geometric modeling task. Fig. 3 Geometry of the piston-slipper component in the maleslipper design cess by changing the geometry and materials of these three parts. This technique is demonstrated through an analysis of an actual crimping process. A simplified three-dimensional model of the piston-slipper component and dies was built in I-DEAS. The Initial Graphics Exchange Specification  IGES  file format was used to transfer data from I-DEAS to ANSYS. Before exporting data from I-DEAS, the 3-D model is partitioned in I-DEAS to create a 2-D cross section for ANSYS as shown in Fig. 4. 2 The Finite Element Model The crimping process analyzed in this study contains multiple parts: the piston, slipper, and die. These parts are axisymmetric around a common axis. Therefore, a two-dimensional axisymmetric model can be used without sacrificing the accuracy of the results. In the male-piston design, the slipper will undergo large plastic deformations  large plastic strain  while the piston will undergo a linear elastic deformation process. The slipper was assumed to obey the Von Mises yield criterion and its associate flow-rule. The stress and strain field for this case satisfy the equilibrium equation, which can be expressed as: The partition command also creates several areas to make it easier later when meshing in ANSYS. These areas are identified by a series of line and area numbers shown in Fig. 4. These numbers are generated automatically when the IGES file is created and may change when the geometry data of the components to be analyzed are changed. In order to generalize the FEA procedure, parameters that represent these numbers are used in the ANSYS command file to match the data read from I-DEAS. When the geometry data of the components change, only these parameters need to be changed. ANSYS element VISCO108 was chosen for the slipper component in the male-piston model and both slipper and piston in the male-slipper model. This element has eight nodes with three degrees of freedom at each node. Element VISCO108 is designed to solve both isochoric rate-independent and rate-dependent large strain plasticity problems. The characteristics of element make it suitable for analyzing parts with large plastic deformations. where D R is a vector of unbalanced force, B is the straindisplacement matrix, t is stress vector, K T is the tangent stiffness matrix, and D u is a displacement increment. The unbalanced force vector D R can be reduced to an acceptable error level using the Newton-Raphson method which is the The piston in the male-piston model uses element type PLANE82. This element has 8 nodes with two degrees of freedom at each node. The element CONTACT48 was used to simulate the contact interface between the slipper and piston and between the slipper and the die. This element has 3 nodes and it is specifically designed for general contact analysis. Element CONTACT48 has Table 1 Material Properties of Slipper and Piston 0.483 0.627 0.529    Material  Youngs modulus E  GPa   Poissons ratio n  Yield stress s 0.2  GPa   Tangent modulus T  GPa   Tensile Strength s max  GPa     Male-piston model model  Slipper  Brass  103.4  0.35  0.345  1.01     Piston  Steel  200  0.35  -  -  -   Male-slipper  Slipper  Steel  200  0.35  0.531   0.703   Male-slipper  Piston  Brass  103.4  0.35  0.419  0.803   L12 these two parts can move together. The convergence is set on the force. The program will check for force convergence by comparing the square root sum of the squares  SRSS  of the force imbalances against the product of the SRSS of applied force and a given tolerance value. A motion is applied on the piston and slipper which are coupled in previous steps. This motion is divided into a number of time steps which is necessary for a nonlinear analysis. Then the problem is solved according to the time steps given. The interval of the time steps is selected based on the balance of accuracy and running time. The time step offered by ANSYS was only used in the test run because the automatic option can miss the peak stress value when the geometry of the analyzed parts is complicated. 3 Results and Discussions The maximum stress during the process, the residual stresses, and the plastic strain of the original male-piston design were examined in detail. The area where the maximum stress occurs is the one more likely to fail during the process. The high residual stresses after the crimping process will create weak areas in the parts. These weak areas can cause failure of the parts under working conditions. The analysis of the process starts when the slipper is about to touch the dies and stops when the whole piston-slipper component passes through the dies. A total of 56 time steps are used for the calculations. Fig. 6 shows the Von Mises stress of the crimping process of the male-piston model when the maximum stress occurs  at the 24th time step  . The maximum stress occurs around elements 11, 12 and 13. Figure 7 shows the variation of the Von Mises stresses in these elements as a function of time. Since the dies are considered rigid, the four nodes of the dies are fixed during the analysis. Thus, no stain and stress is shown in the die. The ball-head of the piston shows some stresses when the slipper is compressed by the dies. These stresses vanish after the crimping process ends. As shown in Fig. 6, the slipper has a much higher stress level than the piston. Especially in the region where the slipper is in contact with the dies. Fig. 4 The 2-D cross-section from I-DEAS the capability to represent general contact of models that are generated with arbitrary meshes. The model after meshing is shown in Fig. 5. After meshing the model, boundary conditions are defined. For simplification, the dies are assumed to be perfectly rigid. A few nodes in the piston ball and slipper are coupled together so that As shown in Fig. 7, the magnitude of the highest Von Mises stress during the process, 0.64 3 10 9 Pa, is about 30 percent over the Tensile strength (0.48 3 10 9 Pa). This result, however, does not necessarily mean that the slipper will fail during the crimping process. Figure 8 shows the hydrostatic stress of the same analysis at 24th time step. Unlike the Von Mises stress, the hydrostatic stress, which is the average of the stress in x , y and z directions, can show if the stress at certain elements is dominated by tensile or compressive stress. The area that has the highest Von Mises Fig. 5 The FEA model after meshing Fig. 6 The maximum Von Mises stresses during the process Fig. 7 The Von Mises stresses versus time step Fig. 9 The plastic strain at load step 24 stress also has the highest negative hydrostatic stress  compressive stress  . The compressive strength for an element is known to be higher than the tensile strength. Therefore, the slipper component will not fail during the crimping process. This result can be further verified by the total strain of the slipper at the 24th step shown in Fig. 9. The highest strain in an element is 2 0.3 at element 11. This compressive strain, although relatively high, is much less than the plastic strain encountered in the forging process  2  which was beyond 2 1.2. The stress results in the 56th time step are the residual stresses created by the crimping process. The Von Mises stress and hydrostatic stress in this step are shown in Fig. 10 and Fig. 11 respectively. The highest residual stress happens at elements 11, 6 and 7 which are located in the area close to the corner of the slipper as shown in Figure 10. Although the residual stress is considerably lower than the highest stress during the process, the residual stress at element 11 reached 0.5 3 10 9 Pa which is about 23 of the tensile strength. High residual stresses create a weak area in the part and may cause deformation after the process  creeping  . Therefore, high residual stresses should be avoided when designing the crimping process. Fig. 10 The Von Mises stress at load step 56 GLYPHlt;132gt; residual stress GLYPHlt;133gt; Although the high stress encountered in the crimping process and the high residual stresses discussed in the previous section will unlikely cause the process to fail, decreasing these stresses is Fig. 8 The hydrostatic stress at load step 24 Fig. 11 The hydrostatic stress at load step 56 1 Fig. 12 Maximum stress at different die angles Fig. 14 The total force applied on the die still the goal for optimizing the crimping process. High internal stresses may decrease the life span of the component. The process will also have less tolerance to the minor material defect when the processing stresses are high. Factors affecting the stress results include  1  the material selection for the part,  2  the geometry of both the slipper and dies. The friction between the slipper and dies may also affect the stress results. In this study, only the effect of the die inlet angle was studied. The inlet angle was varied from 7.5 deg to 45 deg with the slipper shape fixed. Figure 12 shows the effects of the inlet angle a on the maximum Von Mises stress during the process. Among the elements that have the highest residual stresses, as shown in Fig. 13, only the residual stresses on element 11 and 7 are affected by the die inlet angle. The die inlet angle effect on the residual stress of element 11 is quite similar to the die inlet angle effect on maximum stress. The residual stress on element 11 increases when die inlet angle increases until the die angle becomes 20 deg. After 20 deg die angle, the residual stresses on element 11 are stable. The residual stress on element 7 reaches its peak value when the die angle is about 15 deg and decreases as the die angle is further increased. It can be noted from Fig. 13 that the 15 deg die inlet angle used in the original design is not the optimal choice in terms of high residual stress. At this angle, the residual stress reaches 0.31 3 10 9 Pa which is the highest value in this model. In addition to the stress and strain information, the FEA can determine the forces needed for pushing the slipper-piston through the dies and the pressure applied on the piston-slipper interface. The processing force can be obtained by adding the reaction forces on the four nodes of the die. The total force can be obtained by combining the nodal forces in x and y direction as shown in Fig. 14. The pressure applied on the piston-slipper interface can be obtained from the stress results in the piston. One approach is to combine the stresses in x and y directions on the nodes along the piston ball-head surface as the approximate pressure applied on the interface. This can be an acceptable result since the stress on the piston surface is exclusively from the pressure of the slipper inner surface. The FEA model was also tested on the male-slipper design. In this analysis, both the slipper and piston use the VISCO108 ele- For the maximum stress during the processes shown in Fig. 12, the stresses increase from a small die angle and reach their peak values at about 20 deg-30 deg. Then the maximum stresses decrease slightly while the die angle is further increased to 45 deg. In the original die design, the inlet angle a equals 15 deg which is exactly the same as the slope angle of the slipper surface that is in contact with the die. Based on the FEA results in maximum stresses, however, this inlet angle design seems not to be a good choice. This result may be due to the difference of contact surface area in the load steps when the maximum stress occurs. When the same forces are applied on the slipper, the larger the die-slipper contact area, the smaller the maximum stress in the slipper. This probably is the supporting idea of the original die design. By matching the die inlet angle with the slope of the slipper, the area of die-slipper contact surface is maximized. However, when the crimping process begins, the slipper is deformed to embrace the piston ball-head. The slope angle of the slipper becomes much smaller than 15 deg. Therefore, a die inlet angle smaller than 15 deg is desired for decreasing the maximum stress. When the die inlet angle is larger than 20 deg, the area of the contact surface no longer changes with the inlet angle. Thus, the maximum stress beyond a 20 deg inlet angle becomes relatively constant. Fig. 13 The residual stresses at different die angles Fig. 15 Maximum Von Mises stress in male-slipper design Fig. 16 The residual stress in male-slipper design piston design respectively. This is due to the higher yield stress of steel which was specified as the material of the piston. Other than the magnitude of the stresses, the results from both designs are similar. Since the ball-head of the slipper has a lower yield stress than the ball-head in the male-piston design, the concern has been about the possible plastic deformation of the ball-head under pressure during the process, which might cause the component malfunction in working condition. This deformation, however, is not found in the FE analysis. This result indicates that male-slipper design will not cause permanent deformation on the slipper-piston interface. And this deformation is unacceptable for the slipperpiston component. The idea of this new design is to move the force applied on the piston away from the slipper. This will decrease the forces in the direction perpendicular to the piston axis and increase the stability of the piston. However, the higher stresses occurred in the male-slipper design, especially the residual stresses, might decrease the benefit of using this new design. The plastic strains after the process are shown in Fig. 17. 4 Conclusions A FEA model for the piston-slipper crimping process was created in this study using the commercial FEM software ANSYS. Two piston-slipper component designs were analyzed using this FEA model. The main objective of this study is to create a reliable FEA procedure in order to examine the stresses, strains and loading of the crimping process. The results from the FEA model can then be used for optimizing the crimping process. By applying these results on the piston-slipper component design, the work for parts testing during the design is significantly decreased. The time needed for the design cycle is shortened. More piston-slipper models can be analyzed in relatively short time. Due to the large deformation in the process, the stress created by the process can be very high. In some cases, the Von Mises stresses can reach a level higher than the tensile strength of the material. Therefore, lowering both the processing stress and residual stress are the main objectives of the optimization process. The die inlet angle has an effect on the stresses in the parts. A die inlet angle smaller than the slope of the crimped part will generally have lower maximum stress during the crimping process.

      "1 Introduction Planetary gears yield several advantages over conventional parallel shaft gear systems. They produce high speed reductions in compact spaces, greater load sharing, higher torque to weight ratio, diminished bearing loads and reduced noise and vibration. They are used in automobiles, helicopters, aircraft engines, heavy machinery, and a variety of other applications. Despite their advantages, the noise induced by the vibration of planetary gear systems remains a key concern. In helicopters, for example, cabin noise exceeding 100 dB is directly traceable to the last stage planetary gear mounted to the cabin. published. In fact, comprehensive planetary gear dynamic response analyses are notably lacking in the literature. While the present work is still subject to a number of modeling idealizations, the modeling has higher fidelity representation of the dynamic excitations and tooth contact mechanics than published models. In this regard, the presented results provide a benchmark for further development of planetary gear dynamic models. preciselysemiThe literature on planetary gear mechanics emphasizes highly idealized lumped parameter modeling wherein the gears are rigid bodies interconnected by springs representing meshing teeth and support bearings. For free vibration analyses, see  1-6  . Kahraman  7,8  used two- and three-dimensional models to examine the dynamic response of both time-invariant and time-varying representations. Velex and Flamand  9  used lumped modeling  10  and a Ritz approach to examine the dynamic response induced by mesh parametric excitations. In all these studies, the gear bodies are represented using lumped parameter models. Valco  11  used a non-linear finite element model of a planetary gear system to calculate stresses, strains and deformations in the gear bodies under static loading; dynamic response is not considered. Gradu et al.  12  used a finite element model to obtain the dynamic response of various planetary gear systems with different planet spacings. The dynamic excitation, which is typically not wellknown, must be specified externally in that model. 2 Finite Element GLYPHlt;213gt; Contact Mechanics Model Planetary gears have received considerably less research attention than single mesh gear pairs. There is a particular scarcity of dynamic response calculations. The purpose of this work is to characterize the dynamic response of a planetary gear system under a wide range of operating conditions. The analytical technique combines a unique, semi-analytical finite element approach with detailed contact modeling at the tooth mesh. This approach was specifically developed to examine the mechanics of machined, contacting elastic bodies such as gears. The analytical finite element formulation does not require a highly refined mesh at the contacting tooth surfaces. This dramatically reduces the computational effort and allows calculation of the dynamic response at a sufficient number of time steps to study the response in the frequency domain. In contrast, the need for extremely refined gear tooth meshes limits conventional finite element analysis to static analyses and free vibration eigensolutions. The current analysis provides a more accurate and comprehensive study of planetary gear dynamic response than is reasonably possible, or has been conducted, with conventional finite element analysis. Experimental measurement of planetary gear dynamic response under operating conditions is difficult due to the limited access and multiple moving bodies. As a result, few benchmark experimental results suitable for dynamic model validation have been 1 Corresponding author.

The sun gear speed is specified and the nominal rigid body motions of the components are determined according to basic planetary gear kinematics; the calculated outputs are the component vibrational motions superposed on this large motion. The analysis is not of a single, fixed configuration; the teeth continuously enter and exit contact at each mesh as the gears rotate, and the resulting dynamic forces are computed by a thorough contact analysis. It is not necessary to externally specify the time-varying mesh stiffness and mesh contact forces as they are evaluated internally at each time step . These internally calculated quantities comprise the complete dynamic excitation. This contrasts sharply with typical gear models that require a priori specification of the mesh stiffness variation and static transmission error as the dy- Fig. 1 Contact region division into inner and outer regions Fig. 2 Finite element mesh for the planetary gear system namic excitations. Such methods are difficult to apply in planetary gears because these fundamental dynamics excitations are difficult to measure or estimate. is possible with a relatively coarse mesh, i.e., a side of the tooth surface is modeled precisely using just seven elements  Fig. 2  . Four-noded, linear finite elements are used for the carrier and sections of the gear bodies not on the tooth surface. advantages of over the gross A contact analysis at each time step determines the contact stresses and the deformation of the gear bodies. The deformations and load distributions under dynamic conditions are obtained by solving the matrix equation of motion Mx 1 Cx  1 Kx 5 f . M , C and K represent mass, damping and stiffness matrices for the system. A constant external sun gear torque acting on the system is included in the form of an external forcing vector f . Structural damping is idealized as proportional viscous damping. The unconditionally stable Newmark method is used for time integration of the equations of motion with 141 time steps per tooth mesh cycle. Contact constraints are imposed on the discretized matrix equations, and the system is solved by the simplex algorithm  14  . The simplex algorithm is widely used to solve linear and quadratic programming problems. The geometric surface description of the meshing teeth must be very precise for gear applications. Additionally, the contact region is narrow and travels over the entire tooth surface. Conventional finite element analyses require a prohibitively refined mesh to address these problems when one seeks dynamic response. The current model addresses these issues by using a combination of the Bousinesq solution for a point load acting on a half-space and traditional finite element analysis to exploit the each  13  . To experimentally validate the formulation described above, a separate study was conducted  15  to examine the dynamic response of a spur gear pair. The results were remarkably consistent with experimental measurements  16  , including excellent predictions of nonlinear jump phenomena and superharmonic resonances. The approach relies on a division of the tooth into inner and outer regions where each solution applies  Fig. 1  . In brief, the Bousinesq solution and contact forces are integrated tooth contact region like a Greens function to accurately represent relative displacements in an inner region close to the tooth surface, though absolute displacements will not be accurate because of overall tooth bending about the root. Outside the immediate vicinity of the contact zone, finite element analysis effectively models the elastic body response, including deflections associated with tooth bending. The Bousinesq and finite element solutions are matched along an interface close to the tooth surface to yield a solution accurate in both the inner and outer regions. The matching surface is chosen 1  sufficiently far from the tooth boundaries so that the finite domain does not affect the inner region relative displacements, and 2  sufficiently far from the contact surface that the outer region finite elements can accurately capture the reduced strain gradients away from the contact zone. The inner half-space and outer finite element solutions are matched as follows to yield the total displacement in the inner region The mesh for the Army OH-58 Kiowa helicopter planetary gear used throughout this study is shown in Fig. 2. The parameters are given in Table 1, and pictures are provided in  17  . The inner circles of the sun, planet, and carrier meshes and the diamond shapes of the carrier represent rigid bearing races restrained by isotropic, linear bearing springs of stiffness 87.6 3 10 6 Nm (0.5 3 10 6 lbin). Translation and rotation of these races represent the overall gear vibrations and are the quantities presented subsequently. The outer ring gear circle is rigidly fixed. Only planar motions are considered in this two-dimensional model where all gears have a facewidth of 25.4 mm  1 in  . Light bearing viscous Table 1 Gear data for the Army OH-58 Kiowa planetary gearset The bracketed term on the right-hand side is the relative displacement of an inner point r with respect to a point q on the matching surface; it is evaluated using the integrated half-space solution. The second term is evaluated using conventional finite element analysis. The displacements of points in the outer region are obtained purely from finite element analysis. The result is a continuum approximation in the localized contact region and a finite element discretization over the remainder of the body. The remarkable advantage for gear dynamics is that the meshes do not require unusual refinement near the tooth surface to capture the contact mechanics and steep strain gradients. Furthermore, the tooth surface geometry is not specified by conventional element edges. Rather, special finite elements  13  which allow C 1 continuous representation of the tooth surface are used for elements on the contacting tooth surfaces. The shape functions for these special elements are defined using Hermite polynomials whose coefficients are chosen such that the tooth surfaces are represented to arbitrary precision within prescribed tooth surface tolerances. This is essential as precise tooth surface definition is critical when one seeks dynamic response. Because the tooth surface geometry is not defined by the conventional finite element nodes, accurate representation of the tooth surface reTable 3 Natural frequencies of the four planet gear system  steel    three gears   equally   case are  damping is specified to minimize the computational effort quired to attain steady state dynamic response. All gears are steel spur gears with Youngs modulus 5 207 3 10 9 Nm 2 , density 5 7595 kgm 3 , and Poissons ratio 5 0.3. The teeth are unmodified from perfect involutes. Two different systems having either three or four planet gears are examined; the sun, ring and planet gears are identical in both configurations. While the planets are equally spaced for the three planet case, those in the four planet case are unequally spaced at c i 5 0, 2 88.6, 180, and 91.4 deg. The input torque is specified at the sun gear, and the output power is through the carrier. The carrier rotational vibration is constrained to zero, i.e., the carrier rotation is exactly according to its nominal kinematic position and the output torque fluctuates about the nominal value of output torque. (Hz) 3 Natural Frequencies and Vibration Modes Lin and Parker  4,5  rigorously analyzed the structure of the natural frequency spectrum and vibration modes of general planetary gear systems using a lumped parameter model. They characterized the vibration modes into three classes: - 1 Translational modes in which the sun, carrier and ring have only translational motion and no rotational motion; - 2 Rotational modes in which the sun, carrier and ring have only rotational motion and no translational motion; and - 3 Planet modes in which the sun, carrier, and ring have no motion and only the planets deflect. identify the natural frequencies and vibration modes. Figure 3 shows typical frequency content of the sun transient response for the three planet gear system. The computational and analytical  4  natural frequencies agree well with a maximum difference of 3.3 percent  Tables 2 and 3  . Representative vibration modes are shown in  4,8  . The lumped parameter masses, moments of inertia and mesh stiffness used in the analytical model are m sun 5 0.40 kg, m planet 5 0.66 kg, m carrier 5 5.43 kg, J sun 5 0.483 3 10 2 3 kg 2 m 2 , J planet 5 1.27 3 10 2 3 kg 2 m 2 , J carrier 5 49.7 3 10 2 3 kg 2 m 2 , and k mesh 5 350 3 10 6 Nm; all bearing stiffnesses are k bearing 5 87.6 3 10 6 Nm. Notice from Fig. 3 that force excitation of the sun gear excites only translational modes. Analogously, torque excitation of the sun gear excites only rotational modes. Tables 2 and 3 show that the translational and rotational natural frequencies are almost the same for the three and four planet systems. Planet modes occur only for systems with four or more planets  4  . In this analysis, computational modal tests that simulate experimental impact testing are performed on the stationary system. The impulses are forces and torques applied for a single time step. The frequency content of the transient dynamic response is studied to Because the above natural frequencies are calculated directly from dynamic response  as opposed to an eigensolution  , the excellent agreement with the analytical eigensolution builds confidence in the models ability to capture the dynamic response of this multi-mesh system. 4 Dynamic Response Under Operating Conditions Fig. 3 Frequency content of the sun translation transients for the three planet gear system impulse test.

A constant torque input of 1130 N-m  10000 lb-in  is applied at the sun gear. The nominal sun operating speed and torque for this helicopter system are 1600 rpm and 1413 N-m  12500 lb-in  . of Figures 4-6 show the steady state frequency response amplitudes for the radial, tangential and rotational deflections planet in the four planet configuration  radial and tangential de- Fig. 4 Frequency response amplitude of the planet radial deflection at various speeds for a sun torque of 1130 N-m GLYPHlt;132gt; 10000 lb-in GLYPHlt;133gt; in a four planet gear system a Fig. 5 Frequency response amplitude of the planet tangential deflection at various speeds for a sun torque of 1130 N-m GLYPHlt;132gt; 10000 lb-in GLYPHlt;133gt; in a four planet gear system Fig. 7 Frequency response amplitude of the planet radial deflection at various speeds for a sun torque of 1130 N-m GLYPHlt;132gt; 10000 lb-in GLYPHlt;133gt; in a four planet gear system. fi denotes the natural frequencies of the system. flections are with respect to a rotating, carrier-fixed basis  . The deflections are those of the rigid bearing races of Fig. 2 and represent overall component motions. As the gears rotate, the dynamic tooth mesh forces are periodic at the mesh frequency. Accordingly, the calculated response has spectral content only in integer mesh frequency harmonics of the fundamental tooth mesh frequency for the range of operating speeds considered. This result is consistent with the static transmission error model used in lumped-parameter representations. Manufacturing tolerances in practical systems introduce additional spectral content not captured in the perfect geometry of this model. The peaks correspond to resonant response at the natural frequency v n excited in the l th mesh frequency harmonic, and they occur at mesh frequencies of ( v n  l ). This is evident from Fig. 7 where the planet radial deflection of Fig. 4 is re-plotted with a dimensional frequency axis; all resonant peaks clearly occur at the system natural frequencies. No data is plotted in the lower triangular region of Fig. 7 because only frequency content through the fifth harmonic is included. The resonant peaks corresponding to different natural frequencies are not excited in all the mesh frequency harmonics. Consider Fig. 8, for example, where the planet rotational response of Fig. 6 is presented such that the individual harmonics are more clear. The first natural frequency at 788 Hz, which is associated with a excitation translational mode, shows a resonant peak at a mesh frequency of 778 Hz. Resonant peaks corresponding to this translational mode also occur in the third and fifth harmonics at one-third and onefifth of this speed, respectively. In contrast, no resonant peaks occur in the second, fourth or any even mesh frequency harmonic. The second natural frequency at 1144 Hz is associated with a rotational vibration mode. Resonant peaks corresponding to this rotational mode are present in the second and fourth harmonics at approximately one-half and one-fourth of the mesh frequency of 1144 Hz. Resonant peaks for this mode are present in all the even mesh frequency harmonics and absent from all the odd harmonics. The translational deflection of the sun gear, which occurs only when a translational mode is excited, contains only odd mesh frequency harmonics with no response in the even harmonics  Fig. 9  . Similarly, rotational deflection of the sun gear has response only in the even harmonics with no response in the odd harmonics  Fig. 10  .

Rotational and translational modes not excited.  the vibration modes, all rotational mode resonant peaks are absent from the sun translational response, and all translational mode peaks are absent from the rotational response. A speed sweep carried out for the system with three equally spaced planet gears shows different behavior. Figure 11 shows the This peculiar behavior where particular modes are excited in some mesh frequency harmonics but not others is consistent with analytical predictions that address the practice of planet phasing to suppress particular vibration modes in planetary gear response  18-20  . These results are summarized in Table 4 for equally spaced planets. The parameter k is defined as k 5 mod( lZs  N ), where l denotes the harmonic of mesh frequency, Z s denotes the number of teeth on the sun gear, and N denotes the number of planets. The planets in the four planet system are not equally spaced but pairs of planets lie along diameters. In this case, the criteria for excitation of a particular mode in a specific harmonic are given by the following rules  20  : 1  For even values of lZs , translational modes are not excited and rotational modes are excited; 2  For odd values of lZs , translational modes are excited and rotational modes are not excited. For this four planet system with Z s 5 27, the translational modes are excited in only the odd mesh frequency harmonics whereas the rotational modes are excited in only the even mesh frequency harmonics. This is consistent with the presented results. These rules also explain why the sun gear translational response is present in only the odd mesh frequency harmonics and the sun gear rotational response is present in only the even mesh frequency harmonics. Notice that, consistent with the decoupled translational and rotational nature of 1.2 800 Fig. 10 Frequency response amplitude of the sun rotational deflection at various speeds for a sun torque of 1130 N-m GLYPHlt;132gt; 10000 lb-in GLYPHlt;133gt; in a four planet gear system Fig. 11 Frequency response amplitude of the planet radial deflection at various speeds for a sun torque of 1130 N-m GLYPHlt;132gt; 10000 lb-in GLYPHlt;133gt; in a three planet gear system torque range. This static analysis suggests that the dynamic rotational and translational mode responses may have substantially different sensitivities to the input torque. correTo study the torque sensitivity of the resonant amplitudes, speed sweeps are performed for four input torques: 565 N-m, 1130 N-m, 1695 N-m, and 2260 N-m  i.e., 5000 lb-in, 10000 lbin, 15000 lb-in and 20000 lb-in  . The magnitudes of the resonant peaks corresponding to different vibration modes are compared. The first translational mode  778 Hz  and rotational mode  1144 Hz  natural frequencies  Table 3  are well separated, and the magnitudes of the corresponding resonant peaks are minimally affected by other vibration modes. The torque sensitivity of these vibration modes can thus be studied precisely. translational deflection of a planet at different speeds. The resonant peaks corresponding to the translational mode natural frequencies at 780 Hz, 1695 Hz and 2145 Hz are absent in all the mesh frequency harmonics, whereas the resonant peaks sponding to the rotational mode natural frequencies at 1104 Hz and 1743 Hz are observed in all the mesh frequency harmonics. The sun gear translation is zero at all times. This behavior is as expected from the planet phasing analysis summarized in Table 4 because k 5 mod( lZs  N ) 5 0 for any l with Z s 5 27 and N 5 3. As discussed previously, the dynamic forces at the tooth mesh are calculated internally and do not require external specification of mesh stiffness variation, static transmission error or the like. Nothing in the model predisposes the solution to exhibit the distinctive presence and absence of the various modes in different harmonics. That the computed dynamic response predicts these phenomena indicates that the approach accurately models the dynamic mesh forces and contact mechanics. 4.2 Torque Sensitivity of Dynamic Response. Avoidance of resonant response is not feasible when the planetary gear system operates across a wide speed range. Proper design of variable torque systems requires knowledge of the torque sensitivities of the resonant response. How the input torque changes the resonant amplitudes of the different types of modes is studied in this section. Figures 13 and 14 show the magnitudes of the resonant peaks corresponding to the translational mode at 778 Hz and the rotational mode at 1144 Hz for a range of torques. Figure 13 shows results for the sun gear response; Fig. 14 shows similar results for the planet gear. The amplitudes of the resonant peaks at various torques are normalized to their corresponding values at 565 N-m  5000 lb-in  . As discussed earlier, the translational modes show resonant response in odd harmonics only whereas the rotational modes show resonant response in even harmonics only. The peak resonant amplitudes of the rotational mode grow much faster with increasing torque than the translational mode amplitudes. Similar behavior, not shown in the figure, is observed for the translational mode natural frequency at 2110 Hz; its peak resonant response increases at a slower rate than the rotational mode at 1144 Hz. The other three natural frequencies  1676 Hz, 1723 Hz, and 1729 Hz  are closely spaced, and changes in these resonant amplitudes can not be isolated. To confirm this behavior on a different system, we reduced the bearing stiffnesses and increased the planet moments of inertia. The lowest translational and rotational mode natural frequencies are well separated at 622 Hz and 782 Hz, respectively. Plots analogous to Figures 13 and 14 show remarkably similar behavior. The rotational mode resonant peaks increase faster with increased torque than those for translational modes. correThe foregoing results indicate that rotational modes are more sensitive to changes in the input torque than translational modes. In this regard, the dynamic response follows the trend shown by the static response. Hence, the torque sensitivity of the static response, which can be studied with considerably less experimental and computational effort, provides an estimate for the sensitivity of the dynamic response. This behavior mimics that of single The static transmission error of a single mesh gear pair is frequently used to represent the dynamic excitation under operating conditions in lumped-parameter models, though this modeling is considerably less developed for planetary gears. From this point of view, static response amplitudes are a possible measure of dynamic response in planetary gears, and one might expect that the static and dynamic responses show similar sensitivity to torque changes. To characterize the torque sensitivity of the static response, a torque sweep is carried out for a range from 113 N-m to 1356 N-m  1000 lb-in to 12000 lb-in  under static conditions. RMS values of the sun gear deflections about their mean are obtained over one tooth mesh cycle. Figure 12 compares the sun gear rotational and translational deflections with increasing input torque. In order to compare changes in the translational and rotational response with varying torque, the RMS values of these deflections at differing torques are normalized by their sponding values at 113 N-m. The rotational deflection increases more rapidly than the translational deflection across the entire Fig. 12 Comparison of the change in the RMS sun gear rotational and translational deflections as the torque is increased. These are the results of static analyses. Fig. 13 Comparison of the peak sun gear resonant response for the 1 GLYPHlt;133gt; rotational mode at 1144 Hz, and 2 GLYPHlt;133gt; translational mode at 778 Hz. Solid curves denote sun rotation and dashed curves denote sun translation. predicted by simple analytical expressions depending on the type of mode  rotational or translational  , the mesh frequency harmonic l , the number of planets, and the number of sun gear teeth. Response in rotational and translational modes have different sensitivity to changes in operating torque. The resonant amplitude of rotational modes changes more rapidly with torque than that for translational modes. These dynamic results are consistent with static analysis, which may provide a simpler analytical and experimental means to assess torque sensitivity of the vibration. For the unmodified gear teeth in this model, the response increases monotonically with torque.\n",

      "1 Introduction When considering hypoid gears, it is generally assumed that they mesh with a point contact. Crossed helical gears of the same skew clearly mesh with point contact. However, crossed helical gears can be cut using the teeth of one as the cutter of the other, as in worm gears. In this case, it cannot simply be assumed that crossed helical gears mesh with a point contact. It is possible that spatial gearing causes them to mesh with a line contact-or close to it. On the other hand, the current requirement for meshing is only that the scalar product of the common normal vector that draws the contact point on the tooth surfaces and the relative velocity vector of tooth surfaces equals zero. However, this condition is not the necessary and sufficient condition under which a pair of tooth surfaces mesh with a line contact. reaches point P 8 . The vector of relative velocity between tooth surfaces at point P 8 is represented by w 8 . In addition, point P 8 moves arc length ds 2 in the direction of w 8 and reaches the next point P 9 at time t 2 5 t 1 1 dt after time dt , and both tooth surfaces make contact along contact line x ( s , t 2). The vector of relative velocity between tooth surfaces at point P 9 is represented by w 9 . Then curve PP 8 P amp; 9 will be drawn on tooth surface x 2 . This is shown in curve x 2( s 2). Next, it is assumed that mean point P is moved to point P 1 on curve x ( s , t 0). At this point, points P 1, P 1 8 , and P 1 9 are obtained as well as points P, P 8 , and P 9 . When these points are connected, curve K 1( s 2) is obtained. Curve K 1( s 2) is called the slide line which passes through point P 1 and crosses the contact line. The slide line which passes origin P is specifically defined as tooth trace x 2( s 2). The tooth trace will exist innumerably if mean point P is innumerably taken on the contact line x ( s , t 0). A similar definition can be applied to tooth surface x 1 . The tooth trace on tooth surface x 1 is defined as x 1( s 1). Recent researches on hypoid gears and spiral bevel gears are proposed over various areas. For example, there are researches on gear geometry  1-9  , gear operation  10,11  and misalignment  12  . This study clarifies the new conditions besides the condition described above that are necessary so that a pair of gears may mesh with line contact. Equations from differential show us that tooth surfaces of hypoid gears mesh with line contact in the neighborhood of the pitch point. Thus, the elements of two tooth surfaces that have a line contact are determined by differential geometry. 2 Contact Line and Tooth Trace on Tooth Surface When a pair of gears meshes with a line contact, the line moves on the conjugate tooth surfaces with each rotation of the gears. Figure 1 shows where one tooth surface x 2 is fixed and the other tooth surface x 1 slips and rolls on tooth surface x 2 when the two gears mesh. Tooth surfaces x 1 and x 2 make contact along a curve x ( s , t 0) at a certain time t 0 . Then, the two surfaces come into contact along a new curve x ( s , t ) at time t after a very short time dt . In each point on the first curve x ( s , t 0), relative velocities occur between the two surfaces. Similarly, a relative velocity also occurs at each point on curve x ( s , t ). Mean point, P is decided on the curve x ( s , t 0 ) and we let it be origin P. The vector of relative velocity between conjugate tooth surfaces passing through origin P is represented by w . When time t 1 after time dt is expressed as t 1 5 t 0 1 dt , the contact line which passes origin P moves on tooth surface x 2 and reaches the next contact line x ( s , t 1). At this point, point P on tooth surface x 2 moves to point P 8 on line x ( s , t 1). That is, point P moves an arc length ds 2 in the direction of w and geometry The contact line between tooth surfaces x 1 and x 2 moves through space with time t and draws one locus surface x ( s , t ). Moreover, the surfaces of the revolution obtained when tooth traces x 1( s 1) and x 2( s 2 ) rotate about each gear axis are defined as the pitch surfaces. When the pitch surfaces come into contact along one curve, the curve is defined as the pitch line. The pitch line that passes the mean point  pitch point  P can be defined as a line of intersection of locus surface x ( s , t ) and the pitch surface because the pitch line is the locus of contact point P between the tooth surfaces on the pitch surfaces.

Fig. 1 Contact line and slip line on conjugate tooth surfaces 3 Relationship Between Curves and Geodesic Lines on Tooth Surface 3.1 Geodesic Line Contacting Curve on the Surface. It is possible to think of a contact line and a tooth trace as a curve on a surface. Now we have made one point on a surface mean point P. An arbitrary curve passing through mean point P is expressed by x ( s ). s is an arc length along the curve from point P. Curve x ( s ) is considered to be a one space curve. We have drawn the tangent vector in point P in the direction where arc length s increases. We have shown the Frenet frame for point P, i.e., the unit tangent vector, the unit principal normal vector and the unit binormal vector, with j 1 , j 2 , and j 3 . The following equations are obtained by Frenet-Serrets formula when the curvature and the torsion of the curve are represented by 1 r and 1 t . Fig. 2 Curves and principal directions of surface The above-mentioned relative equations of the curve are applicable to the geodesic line on the surface. So the geodesic line passing through point P is drawn on the surface. When the geodesic line is considered as a space curve, unit normal vector n on the surface corresponds with unit principal normal vector j 2 of the curve. Thus, the curvature and the torsion of the geodesic line will show the characteristic of a surface in the direction of the geodesic line. Therefore, the characteristics of an arbitrary point on the surface can be expressed by a very small surface which is composed of the geodesic lines drawn in all directions about the point. That is, it is possible to have two elements that determine the characteristic of surface: the geodesic torsion and the normal curvature of the geodesic line on the surface. 3.2 Contact Line of Conjugate Tooth Surfaces x 1 and x 2. In order to specify the normal curvature and the geodesic torsion of the geodesic line which comes into contact with contact line x ( s , t 0), it is necessary to determine the principal directions which pass mean point P on the tooth surface. Figure 2 illustrates these relationships. At mean point P on the contact line of two tooth surfaces, a coordinate system Pxyz such that the x -axis is in the direction of common normal n of the tooth surfaces and the y and z -axes are orthogonal and lie in the tangent plane, can be fixed. z -axis coincides with the direction of vector w . The angle between the direction of the tooth trace that agrees with the direction of relative velocity w and the principal direction of tooth surface xi is shown by d i . Here, i 5 1 is the symbol for the pinion and i 5 2 is the symbol for the gear. Two orthogonal principal directions at origin P are shown by the s 8 and s 9 axes. Then a Ps 8 s 9 x coordinates system is obtained. The pair of principal curvatures in point P are represented by 1 r i 8 and 1 r i 9 . That is, the principal curvatures of tooth surface x 1 are 1 r 1 8 and 1 r 1 9 , and the principal curvatures of tooth surface x 2 are 1 r 2 8 and 1 r 2 9 . The unit tangent vector drawn in the direction of contact line x ( s , t 0 ) in point P on the tooth surface is represented by z . When the angle between unit vector z and the z axis is represented by s , the following equations apply: Here, 1 r s and 1 t s are the normal curvature and the geodesic torsion in the direction of geodesic line x ( sg ) which make contact with the contact line in point P. The tangent in origin P on geodesic line x ( sg ) can be shown by d x ( sg ) dsg . This corresponds to unit tangent vector z . When the unit normal vector of the tooth surface along the geodesic line and the unit normal vector of the tooth surface along the contact line are represented by n ( sg ) and n ( s ), then n ( sg ) can be treated as n ( s ) in the neighborhood of origin P. Thus, when unit tangent vector is j 1 , the next equation of the relationship to the contact line is obtained from the characteristics of the contact line considered as the space curve passing point P. Here,   p is indicated as a value in origin P. The normal vector on the geodesic line which is arc length dsg away from origin P can be denoted by n ( dsg ). When n ( dsg ) can be shown as n ( ds ) because dsg is minute, then the next equation is obtained. Because j 1 equals z , Eq.  7  becomes: Therefore, the characteristics of the contact line in the neighborhood of origin P are shown by Eqs.  8  and  9  . - 3.3 Conditions of a Contact Line. Figure 3 shows that conjugate tooth surfaces x 1 and x 2 of the hypoid gears make contact along curve x ( s , t 0) passing through origin P. The kinematics coordinates system PXYZ is shown in Fig. 3. The direction of relative velocity w is in the negative direction of Z axis. The X axis is perpendicular to the Z axis and is on the pitch plane. The Y Fig. 3 Contact line of tooth surfaces and coordinate systems axis is perpendicular to the Z and X axes. In addition, another coordinates system based on the tangent plane of tooth surfaces Pxyz is used. That is, the z axis is common to the Z axis and the y axis takes on the common tangent plane of both tooth surfaces and x axis takes in the direction of the common normal n of both tooth surfaces. The angle between unit vector z and z axis is s . The operating pressure angle in point P is represented by f . Tooth trace x 2( s 2) on the tooth surface x 2 is only shown in Fig. 3. Next, we will consider the conditions of the contact line. The point in arc length ds which is away from origin P along the contact line is represented by P ds . The vector of relative velocity in point P ds is represented by w ( ds ). Because both tooth surfaces make contact in point P ds , unit common normal vector n ( ds ) and w ( ds ) should be orthogonal. If the vectors of the angular velocity of both tooth surfaces are represented by v 1 and v 2 respectively and their relative angular velocity is shown with v 5 v 1 2 v 2 , w ( ds ) and n ( ds ) can be expressed as the following equations. The next equation should hold so that both tooth surfaces come into contact in point P ds continuously. Using Eqs.  10  and  11  , the following equation is obtained. are Figure 4 shows the ZX plane  pitch plane  and the XY plane of kinematics coordinates system PXYZ . The following can be seen in the figure: c 1 and c 2 show the spiral angles of the pinion and gear. A 1 and A 2 show the distances of the pitch cone. a 1 and a 2 show the unit vectors of the rotation axes. n 1 and n 2 show the vectors of the velocity, and w shows the vector of their relative velocity in the origin of both tooth surfaces. Points P 1 and P2 show the positions of the origin after any small revolution, and point P 8 is a new contact point between tooth surfaces. n n is an X component of n 1 and n 2 . Points O 1 and O 2 show the intersections of two rotation axes and the Y axis. When the magnitudes of velocities n 1 , n 2 and angular velocities v 1 , v 2 are represented by n 1 , n 2 , and v 1 , v 2 respectively, and the pitch angles of the pinion and gear are represented by g and G , the following equations obtained. Here Fig. 4 Kinematics coordinate system Similarly, Eqs.  10  and  11  become the following equations: tions hold using Eulers formula and the expression of the geodesic torsion when principal curvatures of two surfaces are represented by 1 r i 8 and 1 r i 9 . Using Eqs.  5  and  6  , Eq.  27  becomes as follows. Equations  26  ,  27  , and  31  are the equations of s by which the direction of a contact line is given. Wildhaber  13  shows the following equation in regard to the above. Because c 1 5 c 2 5 c and limit pressure angle f 0 5 0 is for a bevel gear, Eq.  32  holds. However, Eq.  31  which is derived from the same hypoid gear theory, is different from Eq.  32  . Because Eq.  32  disregards torsion, it is a theoretically insufficient equation. The value of s is primarily due to the summary calculations for a gear cutting machine. Therefore, the theoretical strictness largely influences the calculations for development of the tooth bearing. As mentioned above, the contact line moves through space with time t when two tooth surfaces x 1 and x 2 mesh with a line contact. First, both tooth surfaces must mesh with a line contact at the origin. Angle s indicating the direction of the contact line is decided according to Eq.  31  . Therefore, it is necessary to hold the following relative equation between two elements of tooth surfaces x 1 and x 2 . is Using equation w 5 u w u 5 n n (tan c 1 2 tan c 2) and substituting Eqs.  24  and  25  into Eq.  12  , the following equation obtained: It is one of the necessary conditions for tooth surfaces x 1 and x 2 meshing with a line contact that Eq.  33  must always hold. Equation  26  is rewritten as follows: - 3.4 Tooth Trace and Geodesic Line. In sections 3.2 and 3.3, the relationship between the tooth surface and the contact line was considered by using the geodesic line, as described in section 3.1. Here, the relationship between the tooth surface and the tooth trace is considered by using the same geodesic line. Next, p and l are used to simplify the equation: Equation  26  can be simplified for a spiral bevel gear to be the following c 1 5 c 2 5 c , A 1 5 A 2 and n 2 5 0: In Fig. 5, the curve passing through origin P on surface x i is shown with x i ( si ). The unit normal vector on the surface in the point P is represented by n . The x axis is taken in the direction of n , the z axis is taken in the direction of relative velocity w , and he y axis is taken perpendicular to the x and z axes. This coordinate system is the same as the Pxyz coordinates of Fig. 3. Geodesic line x i ( sig ) is drawn by touching the curve in point P. Similarly, geodesic lines that come into contact with the curve on points P1 ,P 2 , . . . ,P i , . . . are drawn. The polygon bounded by these geodesic lines is formed on the surface. When the number of divided points is infinite, the polygon of the geodesic line corresponds to curve x i ( si ). Therefore, a minute part of the curve can be treated as a minute part of the geodesic line that comes into contact with the curve. Next, the normal curvature and the geodesic torsion of the geodesic line contacting the tooth trace are shown with 1 r i and 1 t i . They are the two elements of surface x i . Moreover, the next equa- When tooth surfaces x 1 and x 2 mesh with the line contact, tooth traces x 1( s 1) and x 2( s 2) on the tooth surfaces make contact at origin P. The unit tangent vector in the direction of both tooth traces at the contact point is represented by j 1 as well as for a contact line in the previous paragraph. The geodesic line contact- Fig. 5 Curve and geodesic lines on surface ing both tooth traces at origin P is represented by x 1( s 1 g ) and x 2( s 2 g ). Because ds 1 5 ds 1 g and ds 2 5 ds 2 g are applicable to line elements of the curves in the neighborhood of origin, when the normal vectors of both tooth surfaces in the origin are shown by n 1 and n 2 , the next equation is obtained in addition to Eq.  2  . Fig. 6 Tooth surfaces mesh on pitch plane addition, n 1 and n 2 move along each tooth trace and they change to vectors n 1 8 and n 2 8 at point P 8 . At this point, the following equations apply: r 1 , r 2 and t 1 , t 2 in the equations are the radii of normal curvatures and the geodesic torsion in regard to geodesic lines x 1( s 1 g ) and x 2( s 2 g ). Moreover, the next equation is in the origin. j 1 shows the direction of the tooth trace and it agrees with the direction of the z axis. Here j 1 is shown by fundamental vector k of z axis. Equation  34  is rewritten as follows. The direction of vectors n 1 8 and n 2 8 should correspond at point P 8 so that two tooth surfaces x 1 and x 2 may come into contact: Next, relative velocity vector w 8 at point P 8 is shown by the next equation. Similarly, the next equation defines d j . The next equation should hold at point P 8 so that both tooth surfaces may mesh with each other continuously. When Eq.  42  is arranged as c 1 GLYPHlt;222gt;c 2 by using Eqs.  38  to  41  , the following general equations are deduced. 3.5 Meshing Motion with Line Contact. Figure 3 shows that two surfaces, x 1 and x 2 come into contact along the contact line that passes through origin P. Figure 6 shows that their surfaces mesh with the line continuously and come into contact along the next contact line that passes through new point P 8 after a very short time dt . If point P 8 is an intersection of the contact line and the pitch plane, it becomes the new contact point of tooth traces x 1( s 1) and x 2( s 2) after a very small rotation. Then first contact point P moves to points P 1 and P2 on each tooth trace. Therefore, arcs P 8 P amp; 1 and P 8 P amp; 2 equal arc lengths ds 1 and ds 2 where the contact point moves on tooth surfaces. The velocity vectors of both tooth surfaces in the origin are n 1 and n 2 . Therefore, PP 1 W 5 n 1 dt and PP2 W 5 n 2 dt hold. PP 8 W is shown by vector d j and the angle between d j and X axis is represented by c k . If d j is u d j u , the next equation is obtained. Here On the other hand, both tooth surfaces will rotate only v 1 dt and v 2 dt respectively, in time dt . Unit normal vector n on the tooth surfaces in point P also only rotates at the same angle and n changes to vector n 1 at point P 1 and vector n 2 at point P 2. In c k which shows the direction of d j indicates the direction of the pitch line. It is obtained as follows by a similar calculation: Equation  47  shows the relationship between d 1 and d 2 , if one side is given, the other side can be obtained. When d 1 and d 2 are determined, the equations in regard to the following principal curvature will be used. 4 Consideration of Necessary Conditions 4.1 Necessary Conditions for Choice of Tooth Surface: Three Elements. Equations  43  and  44  become the necessary conditions in order that tooth surfaces may mesh with a constant velocity ratio along the tooth traces. In addition, it is necessary to satisfy another condition so that these tooth surfaces may continuously mesh with the line contact even after a very short time. That is, when one surface is given, a couple of principal curvatures 1 r i 8 , 1 r i 9 and angle d i which indicate the principal direction of the surface at the mean point will be determined by differential geometry. Therefore, if one side of the two tooth surfaces is given, three elements of the tooth surface are determined, and, in order to determine three elements of the other tooth surface that meshes with a line contact, another relative equation besides Eqs.  43  and  44  are needed. Then, because the value of s is obtained from Eq.  31  , the following relative equation is obtained from Eqs.  5  ,  6  , and  30  . As described above, when one side of tooth surfaces x 1 and x 2 is given, three elements of the other tooth surface will be determined using parameter s by Eqs.  47  to  49  . Therefore, the necessary condition equations for line contact become three equations:  43  ,  44  , and  31  . When these three equations are satisfied with all ranges of the tooth surface, they also satisfy the sufficient condition.

The right side of Eqs.  43  and  44  was calculated by q GLYPHlt;222gt; 0. However, it is necessary to examine when q 5 0. If q 5 0 now, the following equation is obtained from q in Eq.  45  . If the pressure angle when q 5 0 is represented by f q 5 0 5 f 0 , Eq.  50  is rewritten as the following: - 5 When the principal directions are known, the principal curvatures of both tooth surfaces are obtained. - 6 The limit pressure angle and limit normal curvature are induced as a peculiar point of the above-mentioned calculations and the meaning is clarified. The equation in conclusions  1  to  5  are basic equations that can determine the gear mesh with a line contact and they become the necessary condition equations of three elements of a surface. Moreover, the denominator on the left side of Eq.  43  should also become 0 for q 5 0. Thus, the following relative equation is obtained. Nomenclature x 5 tooth surface vector this Greek Symbols Here, when f 5 f 0 , let  1 r 1  f 5 f 0 5  1 r 2  f 5 f 0 be replaced by 1 rc , then the relationship among r 1 , r 2 and cutter radius rc in the neighborhood of q 5 0 shows that r 1 and r 2 approach rc and agree with rc and move away from rc subsequently. In change, the sign of the relative curvature of r 1 and r 2 is reversed and the tooth surfaces will cause interference. This is similar to tooth profile interference in the spur gear of pressure angle zero at the pitch point. f 0 is a limit pressure angle and it corresponds to pressure angle zero in the spur gear. Therefore, r 1 and r 2 of the hypoid gears should use the value of rc as the borderline between a drive and a driven side because the solid parts of r 1 and r 2 are reversed by the value of rc . This value of rc is a limit radius of curvature and it should be considered to be the same as the average radius of the cutter in gear design. - 4.3 Numerical Example. Finally, a concrete numerical calculation example is shown using the dimensions of the hypoid gears for the automobile. Table 1 shows three elements of the pitch cones obtained from the basic dimension and three elements of the tooth surfaces obtained from line contact conditions. These figures are required for the machine setting calculation of the pinion and the calculation process of the tooth bearing pattern. 5 Conclusions j 1 , j 2 , j 3 5 Frenet frame v i 5 unit vector of angular velocity v 5 relative angular velocity z 5 unit vector of tangent of contact line d j 5 direction vector of pitch line r , r i 5 radii of normal curvature t , t i 5 radii of geodesic torsion r s , t s 5 radii of normal curvature and geodesic torsion of tooth surface r i 8 , r i 9 5 radii of principal curvatures d i 5 principal direction f 5 operating pressure angle f 0 5 limit pressure angle c i 5 spiral angle g , G 5 pitch angles of pinion and gear s 5 angle formed between contact line and tooth trace c k 5 angle formed between pitch line and tooth trace Subscripts In the study conducted herein the necessary conditions so that the surfaces of hypoid gears mesh with line contact was analyzed.

      "1 Introduction Typical mechanical wrists consist of a serial chain of three successively orthogonal and mutually intersecting rotations. See Tsai  1  for a discussion of these, including geared forms. The first two axes form a pointing system which is a universal joint  u-joint  . This u-joint is a two degree-of-freedom  dof  subsystem of the three dof wrist. The function of this subsystem is to point the third wrist axis, called the roll axis. Kinematic singularities of three-axis wrists occur when the roll axis lies in the plane of the two u-joint axes, Paul and Stevenson  2  . Singularities of the wrist are a consequence of the singularities brought by the u-joint pointing subsystem within the wrist. 2.1 Notation and Coordinate Frame Assignments. Analysis uses Denavit-Hartenberg  DH  parameters and frame assignments as in Craig  12  . Coordinate frame i ( X ˆ i , Y ˆ i , Z ˆ i ) is attached to link i ( i 5 0,1, . . . ,7). For i 5 0, i 2 1 5 7 and for i 5 7, i 1 1 5 0. BodyFrame 0 ( X ˆ 0 , Y ˆ 0 , Z ˆ 0 ) is fixed. Figure 1 shows the frame assignments, except that all origins should be coincident at O .  Note shown for sake of image clarity.  All a i 2 1 5 90 deg  the links are symmetric  . In the configuration shown in Fig. 1, the joint angles have the values u 1 5 u 3 5 u 5 5 u 7 5 90 deg, and u 2 5 u 6 5 180 deg, and u 4 5 u 0 52 90 deg. The linkage is intentionally shown in this symmetric pose. Dextrous wrists have been developed with double u-joints for the pointing subsystems Susnjara and Fleck  3  , Milenkovic  4-6  , Trevelyan  7  , Rosheim  8  . The systems are all actuated symmetrically, usually through gearing. The centers of the u-joints are offset. Six dof manipulators which use such double centered  non-spherical  wrists generally have coupled positional and orientational kinematics, Piepier  9  . Double u-joint wrists are capable of producing orientations without singularities as standalone systems. When used as the wrist in a six dof manipulator, their coupled kinematics has shown coupled wristarm singularities, Williams  10  . Stanis ˇ ic  and Duta  11  describe a mechanical equivalent to these which can be constructed with a single center. In this paper a new type of spherical and singularity-free point05 1 Currently a design engineer with Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company, Missiles and Space Operations.

Kumar Fig. 1 The orthogonal spherical eight-bar linkage Adjacent frames have their relative orientation related by (3 3 3) direction cosine matrices deduced from the (4 3 4) homogeneous transformation  12  . 2.2 Forward Kinematic Pointing Equations. Closure of the linkage in Fig. 1 requires, Closure Eq.  3  is partitioned into equivalent right and left half loops, for i 5 0, . . . ,7. With all a i 2 1 5 90 deg, i i 2 1 R reduces to, where, The right half loop 4 0 R R and left half loop 4 0 R L are expanded from Eqs.  2  , and  5  , where si 5 sin u i and ci 5 cos u i . The direction cosine matrices relate the eight joint angles to the direction cosines of the 0 Z ˆ 4 axis. The direction of 0 Z ˆ 4  the systems pointing output  is expressed in terms of the joint angles by the third columns of Eqs.  6  and  7  . Eqs.  6  and  7  must satisfy Eq.  4  to maintain closure. Introducing equal pairs of joint rotations, and u 5 5 u 7 (9) reduces the eight-bar linkage from five dof to three dof and Eqs.  6  and  7  reduce to Thus, as a result of the orthogonal links and the equal rotations imposed in Eqs.  8  and  9  , The equal rotations in Eqs.  8  and  9  result in a condition where joint angles u 0 and u 4 also become equal. Referring to Appendix 1, from the  1,1  and  2,2  elements of Eqs.  10  and  11  , and likewise from the  1,2  and  2,1  elements, Define a plane of the equator which contains the Z ˆ 2 and Z ˆ 6 axes. Symmetric links and Eqs.  8  and  9  , cause the linkage configuration on one side of the plane to be a reflection of the linkage configuration on the other side. The constraints in Eqs.  8  and  9  will be referred to as the symmetry constraints . From the  3,3  elements, which when substituted into  12  and  13  gives, The orthogonal eight-bar linkage has five dof. With the symmetry constraints  8  and  9  included, the linkage reduces to three independent dof, which is one more than required for a two dof pointing system. A final constraint must be introduced to eliminate this redundant dof. To reduce Fig. 1 to the two dof pointing system in  10  , the final constraint requires that Z ˆ 2 and Z ˆ 6  which define the plane of the equator  remain orthogonal. An equator link which acts as the cross link of a u-joint can be used. One axis of the cross link provides the connection between bodies 1 and 2  the Z ˆ 2 axis  while the other orthogonal axis of the cross link provides the and a single value of u 6 comes from the x and z components of Eq.  23  , connection between bodies 5 and 6  the Z ˆ 6 axis  . In this system, joint angles u 0 and u 4 are always equal, by Eq.  17  , and they change in value together. To reduce Fig. 1 to the two dof pointing system presented here, we introduce a different final constraint, namely, As seen by Eq.  17  , this results in eliminating two rotations simultaneously. Since u 0 and u 4 are now constants these two joints and two links may be removed, resulting in an overconstrained system . As seen in Eqs.  27  and  28  , solutions for the passive joint angles u 2 and u 6 are indeterminate when u 1 or u 7 have values of 0 deg or 180 deg. Eqs.  22  and  23  show that these u 1 and u 7 values correspond to the same unattainable singular pointing direction 0 Z ˆ 4 5 a ˆ 5  0,0,1  T . This pointing system, for all practical purposes, is singularity-free. It can serve as the basis for a dextrous mechanical wrist. 3 The Overconstrained Pointing System Enforcing the constraint in Eq.  18   and its consequence in Eq.  19  , reduces the linkage to an overconstrained two dof pointing. The two half loop Eqs.  10  and  11  , simplify to, Figure 2 shows the new pointing system, which was deduced from the symmetrically actuated orthogonal eight-bar linkage.  Ignore the dashed end effector E for now, it is there for later discussion of a wrist.  As a result of the conditions in Eqs.  18  and  19  , the rotation between links 7 and 0 and between links 3 and 4 in Fig. 1 may be removed, along with two links leading to the pointing system in Figure 2. According to the Gru ebler Criterion, the linkage in Figure 2 theoretically has 3 dof. With the two symmetry constraints  8  and  9  imposed, the linkage theoretically reduces to 1 dof and is overconstrained since it has an actual mobility of 2 dof. The output pointing direction 0 Z ˆ 4 , in the third columns of Eqs.  20  and  21  , would be the approach vector a ˆ 5  ax , a y , az  T  12  , Frame assignments are shown in Fig. 2  all frame origins should be at O  . Instantaneously u 1 5 u 3 5 u 4 5 u 0 5 0 deg and u 2 5 u 5 5 180 deg. All link twist dimensions are again 90 deg. The X ˆ 3 axis now defines the pointing direction of the approach vector a ˆ , and loop closure requires, and Closure Eq.  29  is partitioned into equivalent right and left half loops, where, 2.3 Inverse Pointing Problem. This pointing system has four remaining joint angles u 1 , u 2 , u 6 and u 7 . Only two of them are independent. u 1 and u 7 are selected as the two inputs since they are closest to the base link and should be simplest to actuate. The inverse pointing Eqs. give u 1 and u 7 as functions of a ˆ . Joint angles u 2 and u 6 are passive. Input u 1 can be found from the x and z components of  22  ,  see Appendix 2  , Due to the symmetry constraints, u 1 only needs the range 0 lt;u 1 lt; 180 deg and is single-valued from Eq.  24  . Input u 7 can be found from the y and z components of Eq.  23  ,  see Appendix 2 for details  , Similarly, u 7 only needs the range 0 lt;u 7 lt; 180 deg and is singlevalued from Eq.  25  . These inverse solutions are indeterminate when az 5 1, in which case both ax and a y are zero, which is the direction of the supporting base, see Fig. 1. Once u 1 and u 7 are known from  24  and  25  , a single value of u 2 can be found from the y and z components of Eq.  22  , Fig. 2 An overconstrained symmetrically actuated pointing system and wrist The matrix products 3 0 R R and 3 0 R L and some intermediate matrix products used in the upcoming singularity analysis of the wrist are given by, and a Jacobian matrix for the right and left half loops, and 3 0 R L 5  3 4 R 5 4 R 0 5 R  T Symmetric actuation now requires, 4 The Dextrous Mechanical Wrist A singularity-free wrist results when a roll axis and effector are placed along the approach vector ( a ˆ ) in Fig. 2. The end-effector is the dashed body E. The wrist is also overconstrained, but movable with the required 3 dof when actuated symmetrically. then Eqs.  42  and  43  have the matrix forms Substituting symmetry constraints  38  and the appropriate columns from Eqs.  32  to  37  into Eq.  45  yields, For the wrist to remain dextrous, both Jacobians JL and JR in Eq.  46  must remain nonsingular. From Eqs.  47  and  48  we find, Eqs.  49  show that the right half loop of the wrist becomes singular when and the left half loop of the wrist becomes singular when endThe Z ˆ E axis of the end-effector frame  parallel to the X ˆ 3 axis  is given by the first column of 3 0 R R in Eq.  34  andor the first column of 3 0 R L in Eq.  37  . Substituting any or all of the singular joint values from Eqs.  50  and  51  into the first column of Eqs.  34  or  37  shows that this singular configuration always corresponds to when the Z ˆ E axis has the direction, - 4.1 Singularity Analysis of the Dextrous Wrist. There are alternate expressions for the angular velocity of the end-effector, v  , depending on whether the end-effector is approached from the right or left side of the system in Fig. 2. By approaching from the right side,  symmetry constraints  38  must also be used  . This singular configuration is the same found in the inverse pointing Eqs. of section 2.3. It corresponds to when the end-effector, body E in Fig. 2, has collided with the manipulators forearm, body 0. This wrist has a maximal workspace and it is singularity-free. The challenge is to realize a significant portion of this workspace with a prototype. and by approaching from the left side, 5 General Design Issues Eqs.  39  and  40  are consistent with the closure requirement that, The entire workspace cannot be realized due to interferences between links. Our goal was to construct a system with a hemisphere of dextrous workspace, approximately double that of threeaxis wrists. Only two important conceptual issues are discussed here due to space limitations. Substituting the time-derivative of the symmetry constraints  38  , into Eqs.  39  and  40  results in, The first issue involves joint angle u 2 , which must be capable of rotating from its shown position through 2 90 deg, so that the upper hemisphere of output pointing directions be realized. This is not possible since the Z ˆ 3 axis will collide with body 0. The radii of the links can be varied or interchanged, but this only moves the interference to another undesireable location which has the same limiting effect on workspace. Define two vectors of joint rates, Such interferences can be avoided by replacing some of the revolute joints with spherically sliding connections, shown in Fig. 5 Planar kite linkage Fig. 3 GLYPHlt;132gt; a GLYPHlt;133gt; revolute joint GLYPHlt;132gt; b GLYPHlt;133gt; spherical sliding joint  body 0  and it maintains orthogonality of rails 1 and 5 in the lower hemisphere. Only one of these two t-block carriages is necessary. Use of both t-blocks results in the overconstrained nature of the system. The second issue occurs in mechanically achieving the symmetry constraints in Eqs.  38  . To avoid using four servos to point when a minimum of two is possible, an equator link was introduced in the plane of the Z ˆ 2 and Z ˆ 5 axes of Fig. 4. The equator link allows for a pivoting  scissoring  of the Z ˆ 2 and Z ˆ 5 axes within the plane of the equator link. The equator link supports two sliprings which independently rotate on the equator link. Each slipring is used within a spherical kite-linkage to create the equal rotations required by the symmetry constraints. circular It is difficult to show the equator link and kite linkages on the system in Figs. 2 or 4. Figure 5 shows a planar equivalent of a spherical kite linkage. Counter rotation of links 1 and 2 is realized by two equal length coupler links and a slider. The fixed body in Fig. 5 represents the equator link. The slider block in the planar kite linkage represents the slipring which rotates on the equator link. The kite linkage in Fig. 5 provides for equal counterrotations j of links 1 and 2 relative to the equator. This enforces the symmetry constraint u 4 5 u 0 in Fig. 4. A similar kite linkage is used to interconnect links 4 and 5 and cause them to counterrotate equally relative to the equator, enforcing the symmetry constraint u 3 5 u 1 in Fig. 4. Figs. 3  a  and 3  b  . In Fig. 3  a  , body Y is connected to body X by a revolute joint. In Fig. 3  b  , body Y is shown spherically sliding on body X . There is no kinematic distinction between the two situations, Y rotates relative to X by angle u Y  X about axis Z ˆ . These are two different situations mechanically. The system in Fig. 3  a  would be embodied as a hinge connection between bodies Y and X , and the system in Fig. 3  b  would be embodied as a carriage Y traveling along a circular rail X . The connection in Fig. 3  a  is accommodated with ball bearings. The connection in Fig. 3  b  is less preferred  but necessary  requiring either bushings, recirculating ball rollers  as in ball slides  or fixed-axis tapered rollers between the carriage Y and the circular rail X . The prototype uses the fixed-axis tapered rollers since they had less friction than the bushings, and were easier to develop than the recirculating ball rollers  commercially unavailable for small slides  . 6 The Prototype The six-bar linkage in Fig. 2 has an equivalent system of two t-block carriages and four rails, shown in the skeleton diagram of Fig. 4. The t-blocks carriages consist of two spherical carriages  two of body Y in Fig. 3  b  , permanently joined at a right angle. A t-block acts as a spherical guide for two rails, maintaining their orthogonality. The bodies are numbered in correspondence to the bodies in Fig. 2. Joint angles u 1 , u 3 , u 4 and u 0 in Fig. 4 are reduced 90 deg from the same joint angles in Fig. 2. Joint angles u 2 and u 5 are identical between these two figures. Figure 6 shows a photo of the prototype in a configuration corresponding to Figs. 2 and 4 with corresponding link numbers. The t-block carriage at the base of the end effector  body 3  maintains orthogonality of rails 2 and 4 in the upper hemisphere. Similarly, the t-block carriage exists at the end of the forearm link Fig. 4 Rail and carriage equivalent of the pointing system and wrist Fig. 6 The prototype Fig. 7 The prototype in an extreme position respectively. Further manipulation yields, and respectively. Substituting Eq.  56  into Eq.  55  yields, Moving the second term on the l.h.s. to the r.h.s. and regrouping yields, Substituting s i 2 1 c i 2 5 1 and regrouping yields, which gives the result in Eq.  12  , Two links C L on the left side of the system connect links 4 and 5 to slipring 6. This kite linkage enforces symmetry constraint u 3 5 u 1 . Two links C R on the right side of the system connect links 1 and 2 to the other slipring, 7. This kite linkage enforces symmetry constraint u 4 5 u 0 . The left pushrod actuates u 0  and u 4 through the left kite linkage  . The right pushrod actruates u 1  and u 3 through the right kite linkage  . To derive Eq.  13  , substitute Eqs.  10  and  11  into  4  and equate the  1,2  elements and equate the  2,1  elements which yields the two equations  recall u 3 5 u 1  , The prototype develops a hemisphere of dextrous workspace. Figure 7 shows the system in one extreme position, where the roll axis is orthogonal to the forearm axis and is pointing directly out of the photo. Starting from this position, the roll axis sweeps out the boundary of the hemispherical workspace by rotating itself about the shown vertical axis of the forearm. All above this boundary can be realized and are never near to singular. The wrist uses a telescoping double universal joint driveshaft through its hollow interior to provide the u roll rotation. and orientations respectively. Following the same procedure as above gives the result in Eq.  13  , 7 Conclusions\n",

      "1 Introduction Finding global solutions to a nonlinear optimization problem is a difficult task still not resolved to a satisfactory level by the general theory of optimization. The problem is difficult due to the fact that, in general, the behavior of the objective throughout the space is unknown. The existing nonlinear gramming methods are based on exploiting the local properties of the objective function and converging to a solution that in many cases is only a local minimum. However, several local minima may exist at which the corresponding function values may differ substantially. Most of the time we can only find the functions local characteristics which is the reason for many well developed local optimization methods  1,2  . Only in some cases where the behavior of the function is known, i.e., convex, quadratic function, the chance of finding the global optima is greatly enhanced. Situations where practical results may be achieved are described in Wilde  3  . function prowill be introduced with the assistance of computer graphics which is one reason for recent popularity of this theory. Throughout the paper the analyticity of the functions  satisfaction of CauchyRiemann equations  will be emphasized since this is the main reason for obtaining some important results about iterations. Presumably, readers will be familiar with complex numbers as building blocks of analytic functions. The chaotic descent method and all the reasoning used to develop it will be presented. The theoretical discussion will be supported with numerical experiments. However, before proceeding further, we would like to emphasize that no method today can guarantee finding global minima for the reasons described above; therefore, the method described here is not an exception. One can be assured in success only if the exhaustive search in the whole feasible domain is performed. The exhaustive search is usually unacceptable for obvious reasons, but here is where the method is aiming to bring an improvement. The procedure attempts to perform the exhaustive search in an efficient manner therefore changing a priori negative connotation of exhaustive. 2 Iteration of Complex Analytic Functions interval clustering As a first step, it is necessary to define the notion of iteration of a complex analytic function f ( z ) where z is a complex number. The iteration is a repeated application of function f on a complex variable z . Specifically, if we select a point z 0 in the complex plane C and apply f repeatedly on z 0 , we are constructing, in turn, the points z 0 , z 1 5 f ( z 0), z 2 5 f ( z 1 ) . . . . In this fashion iteration can be viewed simply as a feedback process for which behavior depends on the operator f . When this operator is linear, it is quite easy to predict the outcome of the iteration process. However, the situation is quite different when f is a nonlinear operator. In these instances, the outcome of iterations is unpredictable and its study reveals quite intricate properties. The problem of designing algorithms that obtain global solutions is difficult since in general there is no a local criterion for deciding whether a local solution is global. During the past three decades on the subject of global optimization or related problems a variety of deterministic and stochastic methods for finding global solutions have been developed. Deterministic methods include enumerative techniques, cutting planes, branch and bound, decomposition based approaches, bilinear programming, analysis, interior point methods, and approximate algorithms for large-scale problems. Stochastic methods include simulated annealing, pure random search techniques, and the method. Most of these methods, due to the problems intrinsic complexities, are based on iterative numerical techniques that are all tuned up for fastest possible convergence and satisfaction of different criteria. However, it appears that the iteration itself, as a dynamic iterative process, has been neglected in the optimization literature even though the iteration is in the heart of nonlinear programming. In Jovanovic and Kazerounian  4,5  and Jovanovic  6  it was reported that the process is very much dependent on the sensitivity of numerical computations which was shown to be useful. The analysis was based on the theory of iteration of analytic functions developed by mathematicians Julia  7  and Fatou  8  motivated by a one page paper by Cayley  9  . In this paper, we will show how this important theory can be utilized in search for global minima even though the search relies only on local characteristics of the objective function. We will demonstrate how to utilize sensitive fractal regions to iterate towards global minima. Some of the concepts from the theory of iterations of functions Contributed by the Design Automation Committee for publication in the J OUR -NAL OF M ECHANICAL D ESIGN . Manuscript received May 1998. Associate Technical Editor: M. A. Ganter. We begin with the simplest possible nonlinear operator f ( z ) 5 z 2 . There are two possible outcomes of its iteration process. Namely, with repeated application of f ( z ) starting with a point z 0 inside of the unit circle  z : u z u 5 1  , the iteration converges to 0. When starting with a point outside of the unit circle, the iteration converges to infinity. These two final states of the process are called the fixed points of f because f (0) 5 0 and f (  ) 5  . In general, fixed points are those z that satisfy f ( z ) 5 z while periodic points are z that satisfy f n ( z ) 5 z where f n represents n -fold composition of f , i.e. fofo . . . f ( z ). Therefore, f n ( z ) is the n th iterate f ( f ( f ( . . . ( f z ))) of z . The least positive integer n for which f n ( z ) 5 z is called the period of the periodic orbit, where, given z 0 that belongs to C , the orbit of z 0 under f is the sequence of points z 0 , z 1 , z 2 , . . . where zn 5 f ( zn 2 1) for n 5 1,2,3 , . . . . Furthermore, the fixed point z  is - 1 attractive if 0 , u f 8 ( z ) u , 1, - 2 superattractive if f 8 ( z ) 5 0, - 4 neutral if u f 8 ( z ) u 5 1. - 3 repelling if u f 8 ( z ) u . 1 Fig. 1 Basin of attraction for NR method for f GLYPHlt;132gt; z GLYPHlt;133gt;  z 3 GLYPHlt;192gt; z viewed as an iteration of analytic function N ( zn ) 5 zn 2 ( z n 3 2 zn )(3 z n 2 2 1). For a better understanding of the iterative process of this function a picture of its basins of attraction is depicted in Fig. 1. The horizontal and vertical axes in the figure are the real and imaginary axes of the complex plane respectively. The  8  above is the notation for a derivative of f . Periodic points of period n are similarly classified by replacing f with f n in the above definition. The reason for this terminology is as follows: if z 0 is an attracting or superattracting fixed point, then there is an open neighborhood U of z 0 having the property that f n ( z )  z 0 as n   for each z in U . The set of all points whose orbits converge to z 0 is called the basin of attraction of z 0 . In view of these definitions, using our example f ( z ) 5 z 2 we can classify the two fixed points 0 and  as superattracting. The fixed point z 0 5 1 is repelling. This point belongs to the unit circle for which it is interesting to examine the dynamics of f . The circle has the striking property that it is both forward and backward invariant under f . That is, each point of the circle has its entire history and future lying on it. It can be shown that all the points on the unit circle are repelling periodic points. The closure of all repelling points is called Julia set and denoted with J ( f ). The complement of the Julia set is called Fatou set or stable set and it is denoted with F ( f ). We will adopt the following definition of a chaotic system: a completely chaotic system must exhibit unpredictability, indecomposability, and recurrence. A dynamical system is unpredictable if it exhibits sensitive dependence on initial conditions, i.e., given any initial state z 0 , there must be a nearby state w 0 whose orbit diverges from that of z 0 . The dynamical system is indecomposable if there is an orbit that eventually enters any pre-assigned region, no matter how small, in the plane. Finally, a dynamical system exhibits recurrence if, given an initial condition z 0 , there is another initial condition w 0 arbitrarily close to z 0 that is periodic. Dynamics of f on the unit circle are chaotic. 3 Complex Newton-Raphson Method Perhaps the most widely used of all root-locating formulas is the Newton-Raphson method. The method can be derived from the Taylor series expansion and is represented by Eq.  1  Geometrically, this formula gives an estimate of a root of a nonlinear function f . We take its linear approximation at some initial point xn and solve for an intersection with the x -axis. The intersection xn 1 1 we use later as a new initial point for a new linear approximation. Eventually, if we are sufficiently close to a root of the original function, the iteration will settle in that root. This process brings very rapid convergence of the method but also creates problems widely stated in numerical textbooks. Experiments show that the Newton-Raphson  NR  has the tendency to oscillate around a local maximum or minimum where such oscillations may persist. Also, it is possible that for an initial guess that is close to one root, the iteration can jump to a location several roots away. This tendency to move away from the area of interest is due to the fact that near zero slopes are encountered. However, in view of the previous section, it is possible to make sense of this behavior. Additionally, these problems may actually be of help when one searches for all the roots to a nonlinear equation. The three shades of gray represent the basins of attraction of three roots of the equation that we want to solve z 1 5 1, z 2 52 1, and z 3 5 0. Note the ragged boundary between each of the basins of attraction and all three shades of gray on it. The boundary represents the points that belong to the Julia set of N . Zooming into the boundary in the vicinity of a point that belongs to it will reveal a snowflake picture of self-similar regions of the whole domain. In fact, no matter how close we zoom in we see the whole complex plane throughout the iterative eyes of the function N . This is a consequence of a very special property that all complex functions must satisfy; the satisfaction of Riemann equations. As a result, there exists a theorem known as Montels theorem which states that the iterates of a complex analytic function f starting from any neighborhood U of a point p in the complex plane must cover the whole complex plane, with a possible exception of one point, when the family of iterates of f fails to be normal at p  10  . The event of omitting a point rarely occurs. It can be shown that if p belongs to the Julia set of the function, the consequence of the Montels theorem will hold. Applied to our example above, the iterates of N must cover the whole complex plane without missing any of the roots of the equation that we desire to solve. Moreover, the pictures of basins of attraction we see will assume fractal shapes as it was demonstrated in Fig. 1. Cauchy- Let us begin with a simple example. It is required to solve equation. For this simple function there are three solutions x 1 5 1, x 2 5 1, and x 3 5 0. They can be obtained by using the NR method to construct xn 1 1 5 xn 2 ( x n 3 2 xn )(3 x n 2 2 1). Now, instead of considering only real numbers, we can substitute z for x to obtain zn 1 1 5 zn 2 ( z n 3 2 zn )(3 z n 2 2 1). Initial points for the iteration can be chosen anywhere in the complex plane. The NR method can be Therefore, if one desires to solve an equation for all the roots, it appears beneficial to locate a point that belongs to the Julia set and proceed with iterates of any neighborhood of that point. In Jovanovic and Kazerounian  4,5  we described a method that determines such a point. More detailed discussion with a shortcut can be found in Jovanovic  6  . Once the point is located we know that we will be in the iterative sense infinitely close to all the roots of the equation. Another important property of the Julia set should be noted; a point on the boundary of one of the domains of attraction must be on the boundary of all of them. Mathematically, this statement is represented with Eq.  3  . where  A is the boundary of the domain of attraction of root zn . This result, a consequence of the Montels theorem, shows that the Julia set contains all the gates to all the roots of the particular equation. This is a very important finding which enables the application of the theory discussed in this paper. The above exposition demonstrates that the work of Julia, Fatou and Montel has made the Newton-Raphson method a more powerful tool than it was previously realized. 4 Chaotic Descent Fig. 2 One-dimensional search through the variable space real a i , we memorize only those that satisfy the minimum condition. We continue in the same fashion by drawing another cut through C , offset by Du from B , and we repeat the procedure. Now, when Du goes to 0 and the initial angle u 0 increases to u 0 1 p we will cover the whole x 1 x 2 plane with our onedimensional cuts. Whatever set of minima we found along the one-dimensional cuts will contain all of the global minima. Essentially, we were searching for sensitive fractal areas along the lines in order to locate a i . Many engineering problems could be transformed into a problem with an objective function that needs to be minimized with or without constraints. Such a problem is a central one in the theory of optimization. In fact a goal of engineering design is to achieve an optimal solution based on the criteria known at a particular instance. To achieve such an objective, a number of numerical procedures exist that are able to locate optimal solutions. However, locating global optimal solutions remains a formidable task. In the literature a number of methods appeared to address the problem. Among promising ones are genetic algorithms and simulated annealing . The content of this paper is an attempt to contribute to this difficult problem using ideas presented in the previous section. The following discussion is a short introduction to what was developed in Jovanovic  6  . To describe the main outline of a procedure based on Julia sets that can efficiently search for optimal design, let us start with the following general problem. It is required to locate an optimal design of some objective function F ( x 1 , x 2) where x 1 and x 2 are optimization variables. A two-variable problem is convenient to graphically describe the procedure, but the treatment is the same for a n -variable problem. The procedure just described, even though it locates all of the global minima, is not practical since one would have to cut the variable space along infinitely many directions to locate all the global minima of F . To improve the practicality of the procedure let us further examine the plot of equicostal lines of F  Fig. 3  . Let us imagine at this point that we are trying to solve the problem of minimizing F with a classical method, the conjugate gradient  CG  method for example. By choosing some initial point close to a minimum, CG will converge to that minimum. Assigning a color to all the initial points that lead to the minimum To solve this problem with existing optimization methods one would use a local optimizer  conjugate gradient method for example  to obtain most likely a local minimum. In order to obtain a global solution one needs to exhaustively search the whole feasible space. This however can be a source of difficulty since quite often the feasible space is not known in advance. The exhaustive search is therefore unavoidable since the knowledge of the objective function is usually quantitative  only local characteristics are known  as opposed to qualitative ones  global behavior  . Due to this fact many exhaustive procedures where proposed in order to efficiently search the variable space. The one described here is an attempt to contribute to this body of work. Its uniqueness is based on the ability to locate all of the roots of a nonlinear equation via sensitive regions. To begin let us imagine a representation of the function in a three dimensional space x 1 , x 2 , and x 3 where x 3 5 F ( x 1 , x 2). F certainly consists of hills and valleys, some of which are our global minima. To aid in the discussion an illustration of a contour plot of F in x 1 x 2 plane is depicted in Fig. 2. The axis x 3 is perpendicular to the plane of the figure. Fig. 3 Cutting the basins of attraction formed by CG method The curves in Fig. 2 are equicostal lines of F . Let us now pick a point in the x 1 x 2 plane, label it A , and draw a circle around it. We then select a point B on the circle and connect A and B to form a direction in x 1 x 2 plane. Now, imagine a plane that is normal to the plane of the figure that contains the direction AB . The plane cuts through F ( x 1 , x 2) and is folded into the plane of the figure so that its content can be observed. As it can be seen, the plane contains a one-dimensional curve F ( x W 1 a D x W ) which is a function that depends only on distance a measured from A . Since this is a one-dimensional function, we are able to find all of its roots by using the Newton-Raphson method as it was elaborated in the previous section. We take the derivative of F a 8 ( x W 1 a D x W ) and solve equation F a 8 ( a ) 5 0 for all of its roots a i . Based on the discussion in the previous sections, we can locate all of the a i , However, we are only interested in real ones and those that represent the minima of F . By examining the second derivative at would generate a basin of attraction. Besides this one there are most likely other basins of attraction to which we can assign different colors. Therefore, by starting the above procedure from some point to cut through F , we will intersect some of the basins of attraction. Seeing this we can do the following: when we cut through the variable space and locate all the stationary minima along one direction, we can supply these locations to the CG method and let it converge to a local minimum. With this possibility it should be clear that we do not have to have our Du small because basins of attraction formed by CG are generally not small. However, the question remains-what Du do we choose One choice is to start searching with Du 5 180 and to continuously halve it to get to smaller Du s. When do we stop Simply when no new minima are encountered for a specified number of steps. Another more convenient choice is to randomly choose a direction in the p segment, because random tries will uniformly distribute directions over the whole segment. This would be effective since one may find immediately a direction which contains basins of global minima, just through luck. 0 40 Fig. 4 3-D view of the objective functionF GLYPHlt;132gt; x 1 , x 2 GLYPHlt;133gt; where to start the search remains unanswered. The chaotic descent does not attempt to answer this question, but it avoids it by permitting one to take one step further after the application of the penalty function technique. The method allows one to start efficient exhaustive searching anywhere without compromising the ability of finding global minima if such can be found. The reason is the methods ability to bound and quickly determine all of the solutions along one line through the variable space. The adjective efficient is to be understood relative to this claim only which represents the essence of the chaotic descent . To summarize, the following algorithm can be devised using the second choice above. We start from a point in the variable space and, along a randomly chosen direction by using NR together with Julia sets, locate a stationary point that leads to a best local minimum. Then, we proceed along a new random direction from that minimum to locate the next one. It should be clear that eventually this process must stop at a global minimum, because, as pointed out before, we are performing an exhaustive search. Due to its nature of descending via chaotic regions, the search was termed chaotic descent . We would like to emphasize that the process described above is strictly decreasing the value of F . We only allow one-dimensional cuts to proceed from those points at which F had a value smaller than in the previous step. Until then, we do nothing and just continue searching. 5 Numerical Experiments and Analysis To quantify the success of the methods ability of reaching a global minimum is not a trivial task. The emphasis is on the success of reaching an optimal solution in the presence of many local ones. We selected the following two problems which in our opinion provide ample of difficulties mentioned above. The first one consists of minimizing The first part of F , 1 2 cos( x 1) cos( x 2), provides a wavy surface with many local minima  exactly 441 in the feasible region  , the other part is a cone located at one of the local minima making it a global minimum. The slope of the surface of the cone is .5. This function ensures that the chaotic descent will be exposed to many local minima. Note that local minima are located at  n 1 p , n 2 p where n 1 and n 2 are pairs of even or odd integers. To show just how wavy this function is, its 3-D representation is depicted in Fig. 4. To test the algorithm we need an optimization problem that possesses the characteristics which frequently make searching for global minima a difficult task. Such difficulties are numerous local minima within the feasible region, and irregular boundaries of the feasible region. These difficulties are more than sufficient to seriously jeopardize success of locating the global minimum. The reason for this is usual nonlinearity of objective functions due to which all of the optimization procedures are necessarily numerical and can determine only the local behavior of the function. Therefore, to determine the global behavior of the objective function one has no choice but to exhaustively search the whole variable space. These are the main ingredients of any numerical procedure including the chaotic descent . However, this procedure searches exhaustively in a very efficient manner. subject to constrained The algorithm from the previous section has been implemented in Turbo C 11 with double precision on 486 66MHz personal computer, Windows 95 platform. For a local minimizer, a very fast Fletcher-Reeves version of the CG method with Polak-Ribiere improvement was used. The objective function was implemented using the penalty function approach. The calculation of derivatives was done using a central difference approximation with a leading error of order h 2 . Table 1 shows the outcome of the algorithm starting from different initial positions in variable space. The global minimum was taken to be at  7 p , 5 p . Where d is the number of the direction taken, l is the number of local minima evaluated, t l is the total t me for evaluation of local minima, t is the total time of the algorithm and t n is the time per direction for locating a Julia point and a l of the roots along that direction. All of the values in Table 1 were observed at the moment when the global minimum was found. The results in Table 1 show that the method is very fast for The main problem in optimization is related to the uncertainty of the boundaries of the feasible region and the distribution of the local minima. This implies that very often it is unknown where to start the exhaustive search and how fine a distribution of initial points to generate. To add to the complexity, one is usually faced with a goal of optimizing a function that is highly nonlinear and subject to many equality and inequality constraints. A frequent technique in such situations is to use the penalty function approach that transfers the problem of optimizing a function to that of optimizing an unconstrained one. The technique consists of adding an outside penalty term to the objective function which detracts from good performance, as measured by the objective function, when an associated constraint is violated. Usual choices for the penalty term are squared constraints themselves. This technique, however, does not remove the uncertainty of locations of feasible regions, but it makes it unimportant. Because, it permits one to start searching anywhere in the variable space without being concerned whether the starting location belongs to the feasible region or not. Nevertheless, the question Table 1 Times for finding the global minimum of F   x1-80,x240   X2  - 80     13  16  15    153  233  215     6043961 s  659 s    769231 s  879121 s  1.0989 s   tn  .0169 s  01717 s  02932 s  this particular function. In the two-dimensional case, it took on average 14 to 15 onedimensional cuts to locate the global minimum. The most time was spent on evaluating local minima, on average, a total of .65 seconds. Searching for the Julia points  infinity in this case  and all the roots along one direction amounted to a total of .03 seconds per try. The speed of the whole routine was helped by the very fast Fletcher-Reeves local minimizer. It took no more than a total of 1.1 seconds to fall into the global minimum. Of course, a designer should keep in mind that since in practical problems the location of the global minimum is unknown, he or she should allow more time for the method to span as much space as possible. A decision for the termination of the algorithm solely depends on the designer since the chaotic descent is an exhaustive procedure as any other and it does not ensure finding a global minimum unless the whole variable space is spanned. However, as pointed out before, the spanning of the space is done in a very efficient manner. where It should also be mentioned that throughout the testing there was no single occasion that the global minimum was not found. This certainly adds to the likelihood of finding a global minimum with this algorithm. The knowledge of the feasible region was not needed since a penalty function approach was used. One should also note that selected initial points for the algorithms were absolutely arbitrary. This is really the most important advantage of the chaotic descent . To see this, it is sufficient to try to solve this problem with the existing methods. In the general case, when no additional hints about the behavior of the objective function or constraints  like convexity etc.  are known, these methods search the whole variable space, just as chaotic descent does. However, they need a search region to be specified in advance which in many nonlinear programming problems cannot be easily determined. Therefore, the question that remains is what region cover. One can start from a point in space and try to cover the space in expanding circles with some finite grid until everything is covered. But this space is infinite and without knowing the stopping criterion, this is a very inefficient way to search which does not have a good chance of success. It is also a time-consuming process. For example, in the two-dimensional case for above function, the time per local minimization was about .003 seconds. Therefore, the total time for the search will be .003 seconds multiplied by the number of points we intend to examine in a region which we do not know if it contains any minima and with a grid which we do not know if it is fine enough. Therefore, the total time could be very large without increasing the likelihood of finding the optimal solution. Fig. 6 Desired global solution selected constraints force the mechanism to be a crankrocker with the link of length x 2 described as the crank. Minimize to subject to constraints This optimization problem consists of 10 variables for whose geometrical meaning is depicted in Fig. 5. x 10 is the angle variable corresponding to the first position of the crank angle. This optimization function has many local minima which makes it suitable for the testing of the procedure. this The outcome of several runs of the algorithm is shown in Table 3 where d , l , t l state and t are as explained before. The results are Table 2 Given points on desired curve  de-    sum  To test the algorithm in design we selected a four-bar linkage five-precision-point problem with prescribed timing. For problem we are in position to know what the global solution is and therefore monitor the performance of the algorithm. The formulation of the problem was adopted from Paradis and Willmert  11  . Its mathematical description follows. The problem consists of designing a four-bar mechanism that generates a coupler curve with five prescribed positions. The desired coupler curve to be generated is shown in Fig. 6 while five prescribed states are shown in Table 2. The problem can be transformed to that of optimization. The objective function is the sum of the squares of x and y differences between the given coupler curve and the one generated by the mechanism  Eq.  5  .

However, eventually the global solution must be found since, given enough time, the whole variable space will be spanned. For the examined problem the algorithm never failed to locate the solution within 25 minutes. 6 Conclusion In this paper we presented a method which enhances likelihood of locating global solutions in design optimization problems. The method incorporates a novel idea based on using sensitivity of numerical computations to locate all of the roots of the nonlinear equation. Specifically, we first locate a point that belongs to the Julia set and then iterate from its neighborhood using the NewtonRaphson method to locate all of the solutions to the equation. To make this procedure useful for multivariable problems, we span the variable space with one dimensional lines along which we try to locate better minima for a given objective function until we descent to a global one. The performance of the algorithm was observed on the optimization problems where the global solution was known in advance. We discussed the results in view of the practical value of the procedure. For further reports it remains to compare the procedure with existing methods and to establish its usefulness in locating global minima. Further research should be focused on collapsing uncertainty in more than one dimension which would certainly improve the speed of finding global minima. One approach to this problem is to find a way to apply the fractal conjecture given in Jovanovic  6  . obtained on Pentium II Windows NT environment and represent a necessary number of iterations and needed time for the algorithm to reach the global solution for each run.\n",

      "Introduction This paper presents a new linkage synthesis method which facilitates approximate position specifications. Although pinned linkage mechanisms are durable and easy to build, more expensive systems involving components such as cams, gears, and linear actuators are often the choice of mechanical designers. In many cases, linkage mechanisms can be designed to perform the same tasks as the more complex systems. However, the design process required to create the linkage mechanisms may not be as intuitive. The development of synthesis methodologies which allow exploration of solutions in an intuitively simple format is essential in making linkage synthesis a more practical and cost effective option for designers. New linkage synthesis methods presented in this paper provide a more realistic representation of design problems and present the solution spaces to these problems in a format that can easily be explored and manipulated by the designer. Precision position methods  1  have been successfully implemented in interactive computer software for the design of four-bar and multi-loop linkages  LINCAGES  2  ; KINSYN  3  ; SPHINX  4  ; and LINCAGES-6  5  . However, in many instances, design tasks do not necessitate precise position constraints at all positions. For example, consider a mechanism required to assist a technician in pouring a hot solution from a bottle into a filter as depicted in Fig. 1. This task could be best described by exact first and last positions, PP1 and PP2, and an acceptable region for the intermediate positions. Mathematically, the acceptable region can be represented by allowing tolerances on intermediate precision positions. These positions are then called approximate positions. Approximate position AP1 is used to encourage the mechanism to lift the bottle upwards off the heater, and approximate positions AP2 through AP4 are used to encourage a delay in pouring until the bottle is directly over the filter and also to help avoid interference with the filter walls. twosimple ing the position requirements shown in Fig. 1. Each blackened rectangle indicates that no dyad solution exists for that groundpivot location. The solution space for the second dyad of a four-bar linkage is dependent upon the first dyad. Figure 3 shows a first dyad, W A 1 Z A , chosen from the solution space in Fig. 2 and the corresponding ground-pivot map for the second dyad. The increase in blackened areas indicates that the solution space has been limited by the choice of the first dyad. Through computer implementation, these ground-pivot maps could be explored interactively. The underlying basis of the proposed techniques is precision position synthesis  6  . Most precision-position-based methods that include approximate position constraints also involve some sort of optimization. Sutherland  7  , Gold and Derby  8  , and Ahn  9  added an arbitrary number of approximate positions to the twoand three-precision-position motion generation problem for a four-bar linkage. The approximate positions are specified with precise coordinates. Then, optimization is used to minimize the error at the approximate positions. The search is limited to mechanisms that exactly satisfy the precision positions. The advantage of our proposed method is that a complete solution space is generated which satisfies both the exact and approximate position requirements. Therefore any further optimization can focus on other performance criteria.

Manuscript received Nov. 1998. Associate Technical Editor: C. W. Wampler II. Fig. 1 Design positions for hot-liquid dispenser In a more recent paper, Mirth  13  allowed approximate specifications on all but two design positions. Dyads and triads  14  are synthesized using ground-pivot-specification techniques for three precision positions by considering many discrete points within one approximate position region. Each solution dyad is accepted or rejected based on its ability to satisfy the remaining approximate positions. Although the objectives are similar, the methods presented in this paper improve upon the Mirths techniques by generating a complete set of solutions at each ground pivot rather than a random sampling of solutions. Fig. 2 Ground-pivot map for the first dyad Not all existing methods incorporate precision positions. Kramer and Sandor  15  , Kramer  16  , and Krishna et al.  17  use optimization within tolerance neighborhoods around the design positions for a four-bar linkage. Although positions anywhere within the tolerance neighborhoods were considered acceptable, the best solution was still assumed to be the mechanism that assembled closest to the centers of the approximate neighborhoods. In contrast, all positions within approximate constraints are considered equally valid in our proposed method. The objective of our new method is to generate a set of solutions to the mixed exact-approximate specifications in a format which is as complete as possible and yet could be easily manipulated through optimization. The following sections provide the details of the proposed methods. Overview and Notation position This section uses the example introduced in Fig. 1 to clarify notation. Then, the general approach of developing a set of solutions which satisfy the exact and approximate position specifications is discussed. Finally, this approach is shown to provide a suitable format for interactive exploration of the solution space. treat the where Notation. The objectives of the proposed methods are met using dyad synthesis. Notation for a four-bar linkage represented by two dyads is taken from Erdman and Sandor  18  , Fig. 8.59 a , p. 539  . Vectors W A and Z A will denote the first dyad synthesized. Rotations of W A and Z A between the two exact positions are b 2 and a 2 , respectively. Each approximate position, APj, is satisfied anywhere within a circle of radius r j centered at x NOMj , y NOMj while the corresponding rotation from the first position is between a MINj and a MAXj . The data for all approximate and exact positions for the dispenser example of Fig. 1 is given in Table 1. Nominal positions for the approximate positions are shown in bold in Fig. 1. The dashed lines show positions within the approximate specifications for which the bottle comes closest to interfering with either the heater or the filter. Venkataraman et al.  10  successfully defined the solution space for a mix of exact and approximate positions. Tolerances are allowed on three out of four positions. Moving-pivot Burmester curves are generated for all possible combinations of tolerance extremes. The areas between the curves represent the solution space which satisfies the exact and approximate specifications. Optimized solutions are forced back to the curves which define the solution space using methods developed by Sabada et al.  11  . This approach is attractive because the optimization includes control of transmission, link-length ratio, and pivot locations. However, since the solutions always fall on the outlying curves defining the solution space, many potential solutions are not considered. Mirth  12  used ground-pivot Burmester curves to generate the solution space for three precision positions and an arbitrary number of approximate positions. Mirths approach is to problem as several four-precision-position sub-problems only one of the four positions has an associated tolerance. The dyad solution space for each four-position sub-problem is determined as the area between Burmester curves. The areas for each four-position sub-problem are intersected graphically for a final solution space. Mirths concept of generating the solution space of a complex problem by overlapping the solutions to several simpler sub-problems is used in our proposed method. However, the new overlapping techniques are mathematical, rather than graphical, and require fewer precisely defined positions.

The dyad solution space for two exact and a finite number of approximate positions is three-dimensional. In this work, the solution space is represented by a grid of ground pivots where each pivot has an associated continuous and bounded set of b 2 values. This subsection first shows how dyad solutions to the ground-pivot specification problem can be represented by the single variable b 2 . Then, a general approach to generating a complete solution space for two exact and n approximate positions is presented. The less-intuitive third dimension, b 2 , would be controlled by the optimization. Also, with position specifications already satisfied, the optimization can focus on other performance characteristics such as size, transmission, or any other quantifiable characteristics. Interactively varying b 2 may be appropriate if the user wants to control properties that are not easily modeled mathematically for optimization. Also, if the number of ground pivots which result in dyad solutions is small, the user may want to explore all possible options at each feasible ground pivot. The success of the approach, in general, is dependent on the ability to evaluate the b 2 set for any given ground pivot accurately and efficiently, and that is the focus of this work. The following sections describe in detail the mathematical approach to evaluating b 2 sets for the first and second dyad of a four-bar linkage for motion generation. Evaluation of b 2 Sets For a Single Dyad Consider the motion generation problem with three exact positions. One dyad exists for every coordinate in the ground-pivot plane. 1 The solution procedure for ground-pivot specification  18,19  involves first solving for b 2 , then evaluating the dyad vectors, W A and Z A , using Eqs.  1  through  3  . The vectors R 1 , R 2 and R 3 are defined from the ground pivot to each precision position. Therefore, the expression for b 2 is dependent upon all of the precision positions and the location of the ground pivot. However, once b 2 is determined, solving for W A and Z A from Eqs.  2  and  3  does not require any knowledge of the third precision position. In effect, the third position may be forgotten once the b 2 value has been found. where The proposed design methodology requires evaluating b 2 sets at many discrete points over a large grid in the ground-pivot plane. This section outlines a computationally efficient method of determining the b 2 set corresponding to a single ground-pivot location for a single three-position set  PP1, PP2 and APj  . Reducing the Search for b 2 Bounds to the Edges of a 3-D Surface. Ground-pivot specification can be used to evaluate b 2 for the two exact positions, PP1 and PP2, and a third position satisfying approximate constraints, APj. Once a ground pivot has been selected, new notation is used to describe the approximate position relative to the ground pivot. The circular region of an approximate position APj is shown in Fig. 4. The nominal center is described relative to the ground pivot by polar coordinates R APj NOM , c APj NOM . Any other position within the circular region of APj is denoted by R APj , c APj . Rotations of the floating link within the prescribed range from a MINj to a MAXj are denoted by a APj . If the third position is allowed to vary, all the dyad solutions for a given ground pivot may be represented by recording all the b 2 solution values. Variation of the third position over a circular area with a bounded range of rotations results in an infinite, bounded set of b 2 values corresponding to each ground pivot. Generation of the b 2 set is addressed in detail in later sections. be Normally the effects of varying a APj , R APj , and c APj within the approximate specifications would have to be considered independently. However, for a fixed value of R APj , increasing c APj by some angle Dc has the same effect as increasing a APj by Da 5 Dc . Both cases result in the same solution dyad and, therefore, the same b 2 . This is verified by Holte  20  using the graphical dyad-synthesis technique for three-position path generation with prescribed timing presented in Erdman and Sandor  18  , pp. 524-525  . 4 Therefore, any variation in c APj may be replaced by an equivalent variation in a APj . If the radial distance R APj is held constant, an arc can be swung within the circular area of APj as shown in Fig. 5. The orientation of R APj as it is swung through the arc varies from ( c APj NOM 2 Dc ) to ( c APj NOM 1 Dc ). An expression for Dc as a function of For n approximate positions, a single b 2 set at any ground pivot is found by considering one three-position set at a time. Each three-position set consists of the two exact positions and one approximate position, thus n unique three-position sets can formed. The intersection of the n resulting b 2 sets gives a single b 2 set 2 representing all dyads that satisfy the n approximate and two exact positions for that ground pivot location. The ability to forget the approximate data once the b 2 s ts are generated is what makes the intersection of solution sets from the n different approximate positions possible. Repeating the process for each ground pivot in the plane results in a three-dimensional solution space  two ground-pivot coordinates and a corresponding set of b 2 values  . 4 The dyad is inverted to accommodate dyad synthesis for motion generation. Potential for Implementation in Interactive Software. The three-dimensional solution space can be manipulated through interactive software in a variety of ways. One practical approach is to begin with a coarse grid search through ground pivots. Regions for which no solution exists 3 are indicated on a twodimensional map  black regions in Figs. 2 and 3  . The user can refine the grid in desired regions. As the user interactively selects a ground pivot from a feasible region of the map, one of two actions could result: either a onedimensional optimization over the b 2 set is performed to find the best dyad; or the user interactively varies b 2 and examines the dyads to select the most desirable. The optimization approach is attractive because the user controls the ground-pivot coordinates. 1 Multiple solutions exist if the ground pivot is a pole. 2 To facilitate the intersection operation, all sets are defined between 2 p and p . The bounds of any set are denoted in brackets: b 2 LowerBound , b 2 UpperBound . Sets which cross p are denoted with an upper bound of lesser magnitude than the lower bound. Fig. 4 Approximate position notation relative to ground pivot 3 No solution exists if the intersection of the n b 2 s ts results in the empty set.

If the ground pivot is not a pole, the bounds of the b 2 set can be determined from the edges of the 3-D surface. R APj is held constant along R 2 and R 1 edges of the 3-D surface. Each of these edges may be represented as a function b 2 of a APj , where b 2 is defined in Eq.  4  from ground pivot specification methods, as shown in Erdman and Sandor  18  . This subsection summarizes how Eq.  4  and its derivatives are used to determine the bounds of the b 2 sets for edges R 2 and R 1 . where and The bounds of the b 2 set corresponding to the R 2 and R 1 edges either occur at the limiting values of a APj or at locations for which b 2  a APj is zero. This section first describes methods for determining how many times b 2  a APj is zero on a given edge. Equation  5  results when b 2  a APj is set equal to zero. where and Determining the Number of Occurrences of Zero Slope. The quadratic nature of Eq.  5  reveals that there are either 0, 1, or 2 real values of a APj for which b 2  a APj 5 0. Each of these cases is discussed below. developed Fig. 6 3-D Surface plot of b 2 values vs. R APj and a APj Equation  5  is satisfied for a real value of a APj only if the magnitude of e i a APj is equal to one. Since evaluating the magnitude of e i a APj using Eq.  5  is computationally expensive, a simpler check for the existence of real roots has been graphically  20  : if Eq.  6  is satisfied, no real solution b 2  a APj 5 0 exists. to R APj , Dc ( R APj), is found using the law of cosines. For a given R APj , the variation in c APj may then be ignored if the range of a APj is increased by Dc ( R APj) in both directions. The resulting range of a APj is from ( a MINj 2 Dc ( R APj)) to ( a MAXj 1 Dc ( R APj)). con- The set of b 2 values which satisfy the two exact and one approximate positions may now be determined by searching over the range of R APj from ( R APj NOM 2 rj ) to ( R APj NOM 1 r j ) and the adjusted ranges of a APj , with c APj held constant and equal to c APj NOM . A plot of b 2 versus R APj and a APj yields a 3-D surface as shown in Fig. 6. A single real solution to Eq.  5  can only exist if B 2 2 4 AA  5 0. However, this only occurs under two sets of circumstances: when R 1 5 R APj and the corresponding a APj 5 0; or when R 2 5 R APj and the corresponding a APj 5 a 2 . Both of these conditions correspond to the coincidence of the ground pivot with a pole between a position within the approximate constraints and one of the exact positions. In either case, any dyad which satisfies PP1 and PP2 can move to a position within the approximate straints through pure rotation about the pole. Therefore, the b 2 set includes all angles  2 p , p . A simple check for the above conditions can be performed in advance  20  . Since the b 2 set is known to be  2 p , p , a search for bounds is not necessary, and the case of a single  repeated  root may be safely ignored in our search techniques. Two solutions to Eq.  5  exist whenever R APj does not satisfy Eq.  6  . The two values of a APj for which b 2  a APj equals zero, a APj 1 and a APj 2 , are found by evaluating the argument of e i a APj in Eq.  5  . In summary, assuming a APj can have any value between 2 p and p and the ground pivot is not coincident with a pole, partial derivative b 2  a APj is either never equal to zero or equal to zero for exactly two unique values of a APj . The bounds of all the b 2 values on the surface must occur either at some limiting value of R APj or a APj or at some point where the partial derivatives b 2   R APj and b 2  a APj are simultaneously zero. However, Holte  20  proves the partial derivatives cannot simultaneously equal zero. Therefore, the bounds of the b 2 set will always fall on the edges of the 3-D surface. 5 Edge notation is also given in Fig. 6. 5 The surface representation is not valid if the ground pivot is a pole between any two design positions. Poles are discussed more extensively in Holte  20  . Pole  1,2  between the exact positions cannot be selected as a ground pivot in the proposed techniques. However, since only one point in the ground-pivot plane corresponds to pole  1,2  , the need to place a ground pivot exactly at the pole is unlikely. Using the Derivatives and Roots to Find the b 2 Bounds. The approximate position specifications limit the range of a APj be- Fig. 7 b 2 Vs. a AP2 with repeated b 2 values Fig. 9 Example b 2 vs. a APj curve One Root : One occurrence of b 2  a APj 5 0 within the specified range of a APj requires a more involved algorithm to determine the bounds of the b 2 set. One of the bounds will always occur where the slope is equal to zero. Concavity at this bound can again be determined using the second partial derivative. The other bound will always be either b 2( a MINj ) or b 2( a MAXj ). However, the b 2 magnitudes may not be compared directly until one has considered how many times the curve crosses p . For example, Fig. 9 shows a curve which crosses p once. The lower bound of the b 2 set occurs where the slope is zero, but the upper bound is equal to the minimum of b 2( a MINj ) and b 2( a MAXj ). Fig. 8 Two configurations of dyad, W A  Z A Two Roots : Two occurrences of b 2  a APj 5 0 within the specified range of a APj indicates that the b 2 bounds occur at the roots, a APj 1 and a APj 2 . The concavity of the function b 2( a APj) is used to determine which roots correspond to the minimum and maximum b 2 . tween a MINj and a MAXj . Even if the partial derivative can equal zero for two values of a APj , the roots must still be checked to see if they fall within the specified a APj range. Therefore, within the specified a APj range, the partial derivative may equal zero either zero, one, or two times. The method of evaluating of the bounds of the b 2 set for a constantR edge is dependent upon the number of roots within the a APj range. Each case is discussed below. The number of times that the curve crosses p may be determined by setting b 2 equal to p , then evaluating the W A and Z A using Eqs.  2  and  3  . If the dyad W A 1 Z A does not assemble within the circular region of APj, the curve never crosses p . If dyad W A 1 Z A does assemble within the circle one must still check if the curve crosses p for a APj values within the specified range of a APj . A detailed algorithm for finding the bounds of the b 2 set when b 2  a APj equals zero only once within the specified a APj range is available in Holte  20  . Determining b 2 Bounds for Edges A GLYPHlt;192gt; and A  . For edges A 2 and A 1 , a APj is not a constant, but rather it is the adjusted minimum and maximum, respectively, as given in the edge definitions in Fig. 6. This sub-section references a search strategy for determining the bounds of the continuous set of b 2 values found on either edge. To check for repeat occurrences, b 2( a MINj ), W A and Z A are evaluated using Eqs.  4  ,  2  , and  3  . Then, the rotation of the Z A vector in the second configuration, a  APj , is found using Eq.  7  where a APj 5 a MINj . If a  APj falls within the specified a APj range, b 2 repeats, and the b 2 set is  2 p , p . Zero Roots : If the partial derivative is never equal to zero, the function b 2( a APj) is either always increasing or decreasing. If Eq.  6  is also satisfied, the b 2 set may include all values from 2 p to p as shown in Fig. 7. The same b 2 value can occur for two unique a APj values because any given dyad can assemble in two unique configurations as demonstrated in Fig. 8. The two configurations correspond to two unique rotations of the Z A vector between the first and the approximate positions, a APj and a  APj . Since b 2( a APj) is a continuous function and the slope is never zero, a repeat occurrence of any b 2 indicates that the curve includes every value of b 2 from 2 p to p . The total derivative of b 2 with respect to R APj is required to describe the slope of the b 2 vs. R APj curve for edge A 1 or A 2 . The expression is greatly complicated by the dependence of Dc on R APj. Therefore, rather than deriving an expression for R APj where the slope along edge A 2 or A 1 is equal to zero, a discrete search is performed to determine the bounds of the b 2 s ts corresponding to edges A 2 and A 1 . If the b 2 does not repeat, the bounds of the b 2 set occur at a MINj and a MAXj . The sign of the slope 6 ( b 2  a APj) is used to determine which angle corresponds to the upper and lower bound. A discrete search algorithm for determining the bounds of an arbitrary, continuous angular function is presented in Holte  20  . Within the discrete search algorithm for edge A 2 the slope is evaluated at incremental values of R APj where a APj is set to its minimum value ( a MINj 2 Dc R APj  ). When the sign of the slope changes between two discrete steps, the bisection method is used to more accurately determine local maxima and minima. A pure bisection method is not used over the entire edge because the slope may equal zero several times along a single edge. 6 Any a APj within the approximate constraints may be used to check the sign of the slope. b 2 magnitudes cannot be compared directly since the upper bound of a set of angles has a smaller magnitude than the lower bound if the set crosses p . Combining Information From the Four Edges. Once the b 2 sets corresponding to each edge of the 3-D surface have been Creating a Ground-Pivot Map. High speed computers make the generation of an entire grid of solutions a practical way to peruse the solution space. Examples of these grids and how they can be used is demonstrated in this subsection. An 11 3 11 grid spanning from  17.0, 0.0  to  27.0, 15.0  in the ground-pivot plane was shown in Fig. 2 for the dispenser problem. The designer would like to place the first ground pivot somewhere in this region such that a simple extension could be added to the filter to support the pivot. The b 2 sets corresponding to ground pivots at the center of each rectangle were generated in approximately one second on a Silicon Graphics workstation. found, the final b 2 set is equal to the union of the four individual sets. This final set represents all the possible dyad solutions which satisfy the two exact positions and some position within the approximate region. The entire procedure is repeated for every approximate position resulting in n b 2 sets corresponding to a single ground pivot location. The intersection of the n b 2 sets then represents all possible dyad solutions which satisfy the two exact positions and every approximate position. Only three pivots in this grid resulted in empty b 2 sets  shown in black  . The designer can see immediately that many dyad solutions exist for this particular problem. If the solution map had resulted in only infeasible ground pivots, the designer would know that the constraints are not easily met by a dyad solution. Expanding or adjusted some of the approximate constraints may be one way to generate more solutions. If the designer wishes to look more closely at solutions in a specific region, the map may be reduced or refined. A finer 11 3 11 grid spanning from  25.0, 13.5  to  26.0, 15.0  was generated for the dispenser. Every ground pivot within the new grid had a least one b 2 solution. Example Design of a Dyad for Two Exact and Four Approximate Positions. This section presents an example of dyad synthesis with mixed exact-approximate positions. A dyad solution for the hot-liquid dispenser problem is sought. First, the steps for generating the b 2 set at a single ground pivot for one approximate position are demonstrated. Then, the rest of the approximate positions are included at the same ground pivot to demonstrate the intersection of b 2 sets. Next, solution maps are generated over a specified region of the ground-pivot plane. One solution is chosen from within a map and that dyad is shown to satisfy all the approximate and exact positions. In an interactive software package, multiple solutions at grid points could be viewed. A b 2 of 115 deg was chosen from the b 2 set of  2 54 deg, 142 deg  at ground pivot  25.5, 15.0  . The resulting dyad, W A 52 9.35 1 2.12i and Z A 52 6.40 2 2.32i, assembles in each position as shown in Fig. 3. Generation of a b 2 Set for a Single Approximate Position. The problem data in Table 1 includes two exact positions, PP1 and PP2, and four approximate positions, AP1 through AP4. At every ground pivot, a b 2 set can be generated for each three positions set, PP1, PP2, and APj, for j 5 1 to 4. Details of the generation of the b 2 set corresponding to ground pivot A 0 5 (17.0,0.0) for PP1, PP2 and AP1 are presented here. Evaluation of b 2 Sets for a Second Dyad Once the first dyad has been selected, a second dyad, W B 1 Z B , may be synthesized to complete the design of a four-bar. The objective is again to define the solution space in terms of ground-pivot coordinates and the corresponding b 2 sets, where b 2 is now the rotation of W B between PP1 and PP2. This section describes how each approximate region is reduced by the limited reach of the first dyad. A discrete search strategy is developed to find the bounds of the b 2 set for the second dyad at any given ground pivot. Finally, an example is presented. First, all position data is adjusted to reference from the ground pivot, resulting in the following vectors: R 1 5 R 1 e i c 1 5 16.48 e i 116.1 deg , R 2 5 R 2 e i c 2 5 18.66 e i 32.4 deg , and R AP 1 NOM 5 21.03 e i 108.0 deg . Since the ground pivot is not a pole for AP1, each edge of the b 2 a AP1 ,R AP1 ) surface must be considered to evaluate the set of all b 2 solutions. at Reduction of the Approximate Positions. Any dyad A selected from the previously described solution maps will assemble the two exact positions and somewhere within the constraints of each approximate position. However, most typically, dyad A will not assemble in every position within the approximate constraints. To form a four-bar linkage, dyad B must be designed to assemble within the same sub-set of positions within the approximate constraints that can be reached by dyad A. Methods are presented here for determining the limits on two independent variables which describe this subset. The R 2 edge is discussed in detail for example. The constant R AP1 5 R AP1 NOM 2 r 1 for this edge does not satisfy Eq.  6  . Therefore, the partial derivative does equal zero at the roots, a AP1 1 5 2 120 deg and a AP1 2 52 64 deg. However, a AP1 1 and a AP1 2 do not fall within the specified limits of a AP1 , so the slope does not change along edge R 2 . The slope, b 2  a AP1 , is found to be positive at a AP1 52 10 deg. Therefore, the lower bound of the b 2 set occurs at a AP1 52 10 deg, and the upper bound occurs a AP1 52 2 deg. b 2 at both bounds is evaluated using Eq.  4  , and the resulting b 2 set is  72 deg, 171 deg  . Using similar techniques, the b 2 set for the R 1 edge is found to be  101 deg, 146 deg  . The discrete searches along the A 1 and A 2 edges result in b 2 sets of  146 deg, 2 170 deg  and  39 deg, 101 deg  , respectively. The union of the four edge sets results in  39 deg, 2 170 deg  . Generation of a b 2 Set for Multiple Approximate Positions. The steps taken to generate a solution set for AP1 at ground pivot  17.0, 0.0  can be repeated for each of the remaining approximate positions. Each results in a new b 2 set as summarized below. Only the b 2 values which are common to all four sets result in solutions which satisfy PP1, PP2 and AP1 through AP4. Therefore, the intersection 7 of the four sets gives the final set of b 2 solutions for ground pivot  17.0, 0.0  as follows: The subset of positions which can be reached by some dyad A is best viewed by inverting the dyad as shown in Fig. 10. For each a APj , the positions within APjs circular region which can be reached by dyad A fall on an arc with a radius of W A centered at the tip of Z A e i a APj  an isoa APj curve  . The dashed lines show dyad W A 1 Z A for incremental positions of a APj and the corresponding isoa APj curves. The hatched region represents the subset of positions within APj which dyad A can satisfy. This reduced region is used in the synthesis of dyad B. b set for AP1:  39 deg, 2 170 deg  Two independent variables, a APj and u , are used to describe positions within the subset in Fig. 10. The angle u is the orientation of W A as it is rotated about the tip of Z A e i a APj . The limits on each of these variables can be determined analytically. 7 Intersection of angular sets within  2 p , p are discussed in Holte  20  . Limits on a APj . As a APj is rotated within its specified range, vector Z A may reach positions for which the tip of vector W A cannot reach within the approximate circle regardless of its orientation, u . Limits on the rotation of Z A occur when vector W A has only point contact with the circular region of APj as shown in Fig. 11. If C is defined as the vector from the tip of Z A e i a APj to the Fig. 10 Reduction of Approximate position region by W A  Z A Fig. 12 Inverted dyad A at extreme positions of u for a fixed a APj from a LIM 3 cannot result in an assembly within the circular region of APj. A position corresponding to a LIM 3 is shown in Fig. 11  b  . The angle, g , can only be evaluated if the argument of the arc cosine is between 2 1 and 1. An argument out of this range in either equation indicates that the dyad will not reach that particular type of limit. If neither type of limit is reached, the range of a APj used in synthesizing dyad B remains the same as for it was for dyad A. However, if one or more limits fall within the range from a MINj to a MAXj , the a APj set must be modified. An algorithm for determining the subset, S A , of a MINj , a MAXj  which results in assembly of dyad A within approximate region APj is presented in Holte  20  . Fig. 11 Limit positions for a APj center of the circular region for APj, then the limit positions in Fig. 11  a  and  b  occur when u W A 2 rj u 5 C and when W A 1 rj 5 C , respectively. 8 For either type of limit position, the dyad can always be assembled to reach the same point within APj in an alternate configuration. The second configuration is the mirror image of the dyad about the vector L defined from the ground pivot to the center of APj. The first configuration will always be used to refer to the configuration in which Z A is rotated positive g from vector L . The image configuration will then refer to the position in which Z A is rotated negative g from vector L . Limits on u . Once the limits on a APj are known, the limits on u may be determined. However, the limits on u vary with each a APj . Consider the inverted dyad in Fig. 12. For a given a APj the tip of vector Z A e i a APj is fixed, and all the positions which W A can reach within the circular region for APj fall on the arc traced by W A . If Eq.  9  is satisfied, then the range of u is from 2 p to p because the tip of W A falls within the approximate positions circumference at every orientation. However, if Eq.  10  is satisfied as in Fig. 12, the intersection points between the isoa APj arc and the circular region of APj define the range of u . u varies 6 Du from the orientation of C , and Du is found from the law of cosines. 10 The value of g in each type of the limit configurations shown in Fig. 11 can be determined from the law of cosines. The values of a APj at the first configuration, a F , and the image configuration, a 1 , for both types come from Eq.  8  . 9 For the case of u W A 2 rj u 5 C , a F and a I are assigned the names a LIM 1 and a LIM 2 , respectively. The angle a LIM 1 is always a lower bound for the range of a APj since rotation of Z A clockwise from a LIM 1 cannot result in an assembly within the circular of APj. The position corresponding a APj 5 a LIM 1 is shown in Fig. 11  a  . For the case of W A 1 rj 5 C , a F and a I are assigned the names a LIM 3 and a LIM 4 , respectively. The angle a LIM 3 is always an upper bound for the range of a APj since rotation of Z A counterclockwise region Strategies for Determining the b 2 Bounds. Once a ground pivot is chosen for the second dyad, the function b 2( u , a APj) can be represented by a 3-D surface for each APj. However, the partial derivatives of b 2 with respect to the two independent variables u and a APj may simultaneously equal zero somewhere within the surface. Therefore, a discrete search of the entire surface is performed. The search begins by determining the subset, SA , of a APj values for which dyad A satisfies the approximate constraints. Then, a APj is varied incrementally throughout the set SA . At each increment the range of u is determined. R 1 and R 2 are defined relative to the second ground pivot, B 0 . R APj is a function of u as given in Eq.  11  . The slope of the isoa APj curve is the partial derivative b 2  u . The b 2 set corresponding to all the positions along the isoa APj curve ( u MIN lt;ult;u MAX ) is determined using the same incremental search strategy as was used for edges A 2 and A 1  20  . The union of the b 2 sets from all the isoa APj curves results in the final b 2 set which represents all dyad B solutions which satisfy APj subject to dyad A. 8 Vector names typed without bold indicate the length of the vector. 9 u is used to denote the argument  angle  of the vector referenced in its subscript. 10 Either Eq.  9  or  10  will be satisfied if a APj is from the set S A . The complete set of dyad solutions which satisfy two exact and n approximate positions for a given ground pivot B 0 is found by considering one approximate position, APj, at a time, and then intersecting the n resulting b 2 sets. 25 Example Design of the Second Dyad of a Four-Bar. This section presents an example of the synthesis of a second dyad for a four-bar linkage with exact and approximate positions. A fourbar linkage solution for the hot-liquid dispenser problem sought. First, the steps for generating a b 2 solution set for a single ground pivot and one approximate position will be demonstrated. Then, the rest of the approximate positions will be added for the same ground pivot. One solution from within a solution map is shown. Generation of a b 2 Set for a Single Approximate Position. A second dyad, W B 1 Z B , is to be synthesized to form a four-bar with dyad A generated in the previous example  A 0 5 (17.0,0.0), W A 52 9.35 1 2.12i, Z A 52 6.40 2 2.32 i  . For every ground pivot, B 0 , a b 2 set can be generated for the three-position set PP1, PP2, APj. Details of the generation of the b 2 s t corresponding to B 0 at  21.5, 13.2  for PP1, PP2, and AP1 are presented here. Fig. 13 Final hot-liquid dispenser mechanism positions Generation of a b 2 Set for All Approximate Positions. The steps taken to generate a solution set for AP1 with B 0 5 (21.5,13.2) are repeated for each of the remaining approximate positions. Each results in a new b 2 set as summarized below. Only the b 2 values which are common to all four sets result in solutions which satisfy PP1, PP2, and AP1 through AP4. Therefore, the intersection of the four sets gives the final set of b 2 solutions for ground pivot  21.5, 13.2  . Once the subset S A is determined, the value of a AP1 is varied incrementally throughout the subset. Vector Z A is rotated from a AP1 52 10 deg to a AP1 52 2 deg with 1 degree increments. For each value of a AP1 , the vector W A is rotated through its range of motion within the circular region of AP1 generating isoa AP1 curves. The range of u is determined for each isoa AP1 curve. When a AP1 52 10 deg, the range of u is from 132.7 deg to 154.0 deg. When a AP1 52 9 deg, the range of u is from 132.5 deg to 153.3 deg, etc. Before synthesizing a second dyad, the subset of which dyad A can reach within APj must be determined. Dyad A assembles within the circular region of AP1 in limit positions a LIM 3 and a LIM 4 . The numerical results are summarized as follows: L 52 15 1 5i, g 5 41 deg, a LIM 3 5 3 deg, a LIM 4 52 80 deg, S A 5 a LIM 4 , a LIM 3  ø a MIN , a MAX  5  2 10 deg, 2 2 deg  . In this example, the limits a LIM 3 and a LIM 4 actually did not reduce the range of rotations for vector Z A because the complete range of a AP1 falls within the range a LIM 4 , a LIM 3  . Creating a Ground-Pivot Map. A grid of ground pivots, each with a corresponding b 2 set, is again used to visualize the solution space. The b 2 sets for all ground pivots centered within the rectangles of an 11 3 11 grid were evaluated. The grid points which result in empty b 2 sets are blackened to indicate that no solution can be generated for that ground pivot. Figure 3 shows a groundpivot map spanning from  0.0, 17.0  to  26.0, 24.0  for the second dyad for the hot-liquid dispenser. The map is only valid for the specific first dyad, W A 1 Z A , also shown in Fig. 3. All of the data generated up to this point are independent of the location of ground pivot B 0 . The isoa AP1 curves remain the same for any ground pivot B 0 . However, the second dyad solutions corresponding to any position along the isoa curves change with every choice of B 0 . The vector R AP1 used in the solution for b 2 for the second dyad is defined from the ground pivot B 0 o some point along the isoa AP1 curve. Precision position data is also adjusted to reference from the second ground pivot, B 0 , resulting in the following vectors: R 1 5 11.86 e i 172.2 deg , R 2 5 11.70 e i 15.9 deg . An incremental search along each isoa AP1 curve results in nine b 2 sets. The union of all nine sets is the complete set of b 2 solutions to PP1, PP2 and AP1 for ground pivot B 0 5 (21.5,13.2). b 2 a AP1 52 10 deg  :  114 deg,144 deg  Although the designer might prefer to locate the second ground pivot, B 0 , low on the filter for stability, most of the solutions appear to occur in the upper right portion of the grid. A smaller grid covering this upper right portion was generated  20  . At the grid point where B 0 5 (21.5,13.2), the b 2 set is  165 deg, 167 deg  . A b 2 of 166 deg is chosen from this set, and W B and Z B are found from Eqs.  2  and  3  . The resulting solution mechanism is in Fig. 13. ł b 2 a AP1 52 9 deg  :  127 deg,151 deg  ł b 2 a AP1 52 8 deg  :  138 deg,161 deg  ł b 2 a AP1 52 7 deg  :  147 deg,175 deg  ł b 2 a AP1 52 6 deg  :  154 deg, 2 166 deg  ł b 2 a AP1 52 5 deg  :  162 deg, 2 141 deg  ł b 2 a AP1 52 4 deg  :  169 deg, 2 109 deg  ł b 2 a AP1 52 3 deg  :  176 deg, 2 76 deg  ł b 2 a AP1 52 2 deg  :  2 176 deg, 2 47 deg  5 b 2 set for AP1:  114 deg, 2 47 deg  When driven by link W A , the mechanism in Fig. 13 passes through all the positions in the correct order without passing through any immovable configurations. However, in general, solutions are not guaranteed to be defect free. If no desirable solutions had been found within the maps, the designer could choose a new dyad A from the first dyad solution map. All new solution maps for dyad B would result. Conclusions Linkage design methods have been developed in which the number of positions specified exactly is minimized, and the solution space is easily viewed and manipulated interactively. The number of exact positions required is two, and the solution space is presented as a ground-pivot map.

Rather than using optimization to find the solution space, optimization could be incorporated within the solution space, to improve the designers ability to find good working solutions. The mapping format lends itself well to 1-D optimization which could be performed within each b 2 set as the map is generated. In this manner, ground pivots could be ranked based on some optimization criteria, and then shaded or colored in the map to indicate their rank.\n",

      "1 Introduction 2 Determination of the Bending Strength Geometry Factor AGMA  2  defines the bending strength geometry factor J as Based on the work of Lewis  1  , AGMA  2  has established an improved model for the elastic behavior of gear teeth, which uses the Lewis parabola to determine the critical section by the tangency point of the parabola and the tooth profile. For the cases in which the tangency point is placed on the involute, the J factor can be computed analytically  3  , but usually this point is placed over the root fillet, whose equations are complicated. where every symbol has been described in the nomenclature section. In this equation, - m n and c are given - C c , m N , c r , f nL , f nr and C h  11  can be computed before determining the critical section - tool  K f  12  , sF and hF can be computed from the critical section parameter procedure The problem is to determine the critical section parameter from the condition of tangency of the Lewis parabola and the root trochoid, and numerical techniques with iterative procedures are required. This iterative calculation is what in this work will be replaced by an analytic calculation, which allows computing the J factor without iterations. Mitchiner and Mabie  4  developed a method valid for racktype, standard spur gears, and tables for the AGMA J -factor for usual sets of tooth proportions were given, but neither center distance modifications nor hob offsets nor backlash were considered. Based on the work of Errichello  5-7  , AGMA  2  developed an augmented method considering spur and helical gears, rack-type or pinion-type cutters, tool protuberance, offsets and backlash. This method is general and provides extremely accurate results, but involves an iterative very tedious to implement into a computer program. Also, the iterative nature of the procedure implies that it would be time consuming when used repeatedly, as a part of power transmission optimization  8,9  . 2.1 Parameters Not Depending on the Critical Section. C c , m N , c r , f nr and C h are all independent of the critical section parameter a n . Equations can be found in  2  . From Fig. 1, the load angle f nL is An approximate equation for the J factor has been reported by Carroll and Johnson  10  , but it is only valid for spur gears generated by rack with no backlash, no tool shift and standard center distance. No similar methods have been reported for helical gears. This paper presents an approximate, accurate method for the determination of the critical section parameter, from whose value the J factor can be computed analytically. This method is valid for any set of tool proportions and any values of the tooth numbers, rack shift coefficients, operating center distances, axial contact ratios and helix angles. Moreover, it allows considering the load acting at the tip or at the highest point of single tooth contact  HPSTC  . where rnC is the virtual contact radius and g b the angle between both tooth involutes at the virtual base radius Contributed by the Reliability Stress Analysis amp; Failure Prevention Committee for publication in the J OURNAL OF M ECHANICAL D ESIGN . Manuscript received Aug. 1999. Associate Technical Editor: J. Gao. AGMA computes rnC at the tip or at the HPSTC, depending on the axial contact ratio. Consequently, from Fig. 2, Fig. 2 Load radius at the highest point of single tooth contact Fig. 3 Root fillet generation where subindex 2 denotes the mating gear. Neither rnC nor g b are a function of a n . - 2.2 Parameters Depending on the Critical Section. K f , sF and hF can be only computed from the value of a n . From Fig. 3, where g is the angle between the tooth centerline and the line of centers, and d is the distance between the rolling point and the generating tool tip point, both at the moment in which the critical section is generated. The tooth root is generated at the line of centers, so that the angle g can be expressed as where subindex 0 denotes the tool. Finally, the stress correction factor K f is given as a function of sF and hF  2  . - 2.3 Determination of the Critical Section. From Fig. 3 and the parabolas properties, a n should verify Fig. 4 Rack-type generation and, replacing Eqs.  5  in Eq.  9  where g d is the gear angular thickness at the root and Dg the angle rotated by the gear between the generation of the root and the generation of the critical section. For rack generation, as seen in Fig. 4, g d , Dg and d are while for pinion-cutter generation, as seen in Fig. 5, Fig. 5 Pinion-type generation This equation yields the value of the critical section parameter, but it is a highly non-linear equation, which requires numerical methods to be solved. AGMA  2  uses the Newton-Raphson technique, which achieves convergency in a small number of iterations and provides very accurate results, but it is very tedious to implement in this case. Other techniques may be easier to implement, but they are less efficient because they require more iteration steps. 3 Approximate Method Very accurate calculations are not usually required for design purposes, and diagrams or approximate equations may be suitable. But the J factor depends on many parameters, so it is almost impossible to build diagrams or tables for general use. The same problem arises when looking for regressions accurate enough with such a great number of variables. However, the problem is different for the critical section parameter. As seen in Eqs.  7  ,  8  , and  10  , a n only depends on the tool geometric parameters, n , x , and f nL . Then, for a given set of tool proportions, it is possible to express the critical section parameter as a function of these three parameters, while all the other parameters in Eq.  1  can be computed analytically. Consequently, the J factor cannot be tabulated, but tables or diagrams for the critical section parameter can be obtained, from which the J factor can be computed after some analytic calculations. Similarly, regressions for a n may be studied with only three variables. Figure 6 shows an example of these diagrams, which are enough to determine the J factor for any value for the transmission parameters, for a given tool. They are also valid for load acting at the tip or at the HPSTC, since this condition is involved in the value of f nL . Transverse backlash can be also considered as its value is given by  13  Fig. 6 Critical section parameter a n for f n  25 deg, rf  0.3,a  1,h a0  1.25 and its influence on the critical section parameter is involved in the rack shift coefficient and the load angle  through the operating transverse pressure angle f r ). As the critical section parameter is a function of n , x , and f nL , an approximate equation might be obtained by correlating these three parameters. A simple expression has been studied: Table 1 Coefficient for a n 0 Table 1 shows the values of the coefficients for some usual sets of tooth proportions, which have been obtained by multiple linear regression from 600 points for every set. A general expression suitable for any values of the tool parameters, from a regression study with 1800 points of different tools  360 of each one  , has also been obtained     Coefficients  Coefficients  Coefficients  Coefficients      h       25 deg  0.300  25  0.93403  5.37189  0.07133  22235   20de8  0.300  125  0.84899  5.79815  0.08360  1.19930   20deg  0.350  1.40  0.80848  6.08144  0.07222  1.13077    0.245  1.35  0.89552  5.68451  0.06127  06552   20 deg  0.304  1.00  0.88541  5.06784  0.09923  121314  Unfortunately, Eqs.  12  and  13  are not accurate enough. The correlation coefficients obtained from the regression analysis were Fig. 7 Approximation of angle Dg 0.89 for Eq.  12  and 0.80 for Eq.  13  . But accuracy may be also achieved with the following method. From Fig. 3, Dg for pinioncutter generation can be expressed as while, from Fig. 7, consequently Comparing this expression with Eq.  7  , we have, being Angle j in Fig. 3 verifies where g and f nL decrease with a n , therefore j increases. Then, we can assume and replacing Eqs.  17  and  20  in Eq.  19  , we have Parameters A , g d and f nL in Eq.  21  are known. B can be computed from the same expression, for a value of the critical section parameter a n 0 close to the real one, as ones given by Eqs.  12  or  13  . For this a n 0 , g ( a n 0) and d ( a n 0) can be computed from Eqs.  6  8  , and f nL ( a n 0) from Eq.  10  . This f nL ( a n 0) would be the load angle if the critical section were the section defined by a n 0 . Consequently, f nL ( a n 0) and a n 0 should verify Eq.  21  B 2 a n 0 and, replacing in Eq.  21  This value of a n defines the critical section very accurately. An error of 1 or 2 percent in the J factor is rather insignificant, and the accuracy of the method is much better than 99 percent. From the above considerations, the analytic, non-iterative method for computing the AGMAJ factor can be summarized as follows: - Compute f nL from Eqs.  2  4  - Compute a n 0 from Eq.  13  , or Eq.  12  and Table 1, if preferable - Compute f nL ( a n 0) from Eqs.  6  8  and  10  - Compute sF and hF from Eqs.  6  8  and  5  , and J from Eq.  1  - Compute a n from Eq.  23  It is important to remark that the method is valid for any tool proportions, including rack-type or pinion-type generation, any gear geometry, any load point and any operating conditions. 4 Results A study considering 600 different gear pairs, with different tooth numbers, rack shift coefficients, load angles and tooth proportions, has been developed. The J factor has been estimated from the above method and compared with the exact value obtained from method described in  2  . The average error obtained was 0.016 percent, while the maximum one was slightly greater than 1.05 percent. Error was less than 0.1 percent in 95 percent of the cases, and decreases significantly until 0.005 percent, for tooth numbers between 20 and 80, which is the most frequent interval. 5 Conclusions Diagrams or tabular values for the bending strength geometry factor are not possible to build because of the high number of parameters the J factor depends on. For the same reason, approximate equations obtained by correlation of many factors are almost impossible to get. The J factor can be analytically computed from the value of the critical section parameter, but this parameter depends on many factors too. However, the influence of many of these factors are involved in the load angle, so that it has been possible to express the critical section parameter as a function of only three parameters  the tooth number, the rack shift coefficient and the load angle  for each set of tooth proportions. - parameter, Dg 5 angle rotated from the generation of the root - f 5 standard transverse pressure angle - f n 5 standard normal pressure angle - f nr 5 operating normal pressure angle - f nL 5 load angle - f r 5 operating transverse pressure angle An approximate equation for the critical section obtained by multiple linear regression of the above three factors, has been presented.

Gabriele 2 Mechanical Engineering, Aeronautical Engineering and Mechanics, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY 12180 A Method for Attachment Design Concept Development in Integral Snap-fit Assemblies The importance and foundation for attachment-level design of integral snap-fit assemblies was first pointed out by Bonenberger at General Motors 1 -3. Based on that work, a method was developed and tested and is presented here to identify and address important issues at the conceptual stage in a systematic way and generate alternative attachment concepts. The method starts by exploring the design space to generate as many concepts as possible 4. Alternative concepts are generated by considering variations in attachment interface geometry, assembly procedures, actual snap-fit features, and options for fully constraining all parts of the assembly using locators beyond locks. In the last step alternatives are evaluated using a quantitative tool, and a best attachment concept is selected based on design objectives for a particular application. Applying the method to case studies has confirmed that it is a useful design aid for efficiently generating, and evaluating, or simply checking attachment concepts.  S1050-0472  00  01003-5  Keywords: Design Method, Concept Generation or Development, Integral Attachment, Integral Snap-fit Features, Snap-fit Assembly Overview of Integral Attachment Design The use of integral features for attachment assembly is highly recommended to reduce overall product cost by reducing the number of parts and eliminating conventional fasteners  5-7  . Integral attachment features used in plastic part design and manufacture include any and all elements at the interface between parts of an assembly used to enable, assist in, or enhance attachment  8  . These fall into one of three subcategories:  1  elastic,  2  plastic, or  3  rigid features  9  . Integral snap-fit features offer the additional advantages of low insertion force, significant force, no requirement for installation tools, reduced installation time, and built-in indication of quality  i.e., the snap   10  .  1-3  . The geometry of the parts to be attached, applicable installation directions and assembly motions, and numbers, locations, and orientations of integral attachment features on the actively used surfaces or interfaces of the parts being attached were all considered at what Bonenberger called the attachment-level. Genc, et al.  15  grouped these issues into three categories:  1  part interface geometry;  2  assembly procedure; and  3  attachment feature information. Figure 1 shows integral attachment design stages in the overall design process. retention The conceptual design stage consists of two major activities:  1  concept generation; and  2  concept evaluation  12  . Although a number of different concept generation and evaluation techniques have been presented in the literature, each presents only general rules, and none can be easily applied to the integral attachment design problem. Design with integral snap-fit attachment features  one form of integral attachment design  , like all design, can be broadly divided in three principal stages:  1  problem formulation andor design specification;  2  conceptual design; and  3  detail design. In the design specification stage, inputs such as design objectives, constraints, and any other concern  s  are identified, i.e., the problem is defined. Conceptual design or, as it is sometimes called, configuration design  11  , layout design or scheme design or draft  12  , or qualitative synthesis  13  , deals with how parts come together to function in an assembly or structure, what and how features beyond just those for attachment are to be used, their relative positions on the parts, etc. Detail design involves actual sizing of features, dimensioning their locations, and prescribing tolerances. These three stages correspond to those presented by Pugh  14  . In this study of integral attachment design, the conceptual stage deals with issues relating to how two parts come together to accomplish attachment as opposed to how the specific attachment features perform. The foundation for the integral attachment of two parts using snap-fit features was described by Bonenberger 1 Dr. Suat Genc is now working as a development engineer for Plug Latham, New York. 2 Professors Robert W. Messler, Jr., Materials Science and Engineering, and Gary A. Gabriele, Mechanical Engineering, Aeronautical Engineering, and Mechanics, co-advised Mr. Genc in his Ph.D. thesis in Mechanical Engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, New York. The work-and resulting method-presented in this paper is the culmination of a systematic and thorough study performed over a period of more than 4 years. As stated earlier, it builds on the foundation laid by Bonenberger  1-3  . The specific work presented goes well beyond  but is obviously based on  what was presented in Genc, et al.  4  . That paper focused on an effort to identify the size and boundaries of the design space associated with integral snap-fit attachment  or assembly  in the most general sense. The outcome of that effort  and the subject of that paper  is that the design space is  contrary to an initial perception  bounded, and that the total number of all possible ways in which parts can come together is surprisingly limited to about 155 unique ways. That paper did not deal with actual assembly procedures, snap-fit feature information, or evaluation of alternative attachment concepts. Most importantly, it did not present a method for generating or developing a best attachment solution for a particular application. Other papers by Genc and Bonenberger and Luscher, and their colleagues, are stand-alone works focusing on different aspects of the attachment design process, but do not present a complete process or method-or rules-to take the designer from the beginning to the end of the design task.

This paper makes an important and unique contribution to the field of integral attachment design by presenting a step-by-step procedure that brings together all earlier work of the authors and Bonenberger. It also provides a foundation or framework for the Fig. 2 Steps for generating and evaluating alternative attachment concepts GLYPHlt;132gt; from Genc, et al., 1997b GLYPHlt;133gt; Fig. 1 Integral attachment design in the overall design process development of a software tool to create alternative attachment strategies for parts to be assembled using snap-fit perhaps even automatically features or essential  geometry of attachment surfaces and the final arrangement of parts in the assembly, then continues with identification of possible assembly procedures, and ends with alternative attachment feature selection and placement. In this manner, attachment concepts evolve as the roots on a tree; starting from a base and moving downward and outward with increasing details  Fig. 2  . Following are the steps to be executed throughout the attachment design. The Design Method In practice, attachment design with integral snap-fit features has been an art more than a science. More often than not, designers use their experience with prior applications along with their intuition to approach new applications. Therefore, they neither explore the entire design space for a particular case, nor can they readily transfer technology to new designs or other designers. Conceptual design issues were identified and summarized in the previous section as dividing into three categories including:  1  part interface geometry issues;  2  assembly procedure issues; and  3  attachment feature issues. The design method presented here addresses each of these issues, evaluates alternative attachment concepts, and selects the best one  s  in six subsequent steps:  1  identification of parts  or part classification  ;  2  identification of part combinations;  3  identification of applicable assembly procedures;  4  identification and selection of locking features;  5  kinematic constraining of parts and load-bearing capacity of attachment features; and, finally,  6  evaluation of and selection among alternatives. These steps are shown in Fig. 1. Step 1: Identification of Possible Attachment Geometry for Parts; i.e., Part Classification. Alternative attachment concept generation starts with identification of the basic or essential geometry of attachment surfaces and final part arrangement in the assembly  2,4  . The basic or essential geometry of attachment surfaces  or attachment geometry  refers to the portions or volumes of parts actively involved in the attachment process either by simple surface interaction or attachment feature placement  15-17  . Rather than using the real part geometry, an abstract geometry which represents the essential portions of the parts is used. Such geometry is referred to by Genc and co-workers as representative shape . Possible representative shapes for parts using integral attachment features, and a hierarchical classification scheme of representative shapes was presented by Genc, et al.  4  , and is shown  for convenience of reference  in Fig. 3. Steps of the Design Method At each step of the method, the designer tries to identify all possible solutions or design options. The ultimate objective of using such a method is to generate alternative attachment concepts that are representative of all feasible possibilities based on design objectives and constraints for a particular application leading to so many options that optimization is intractable overly tedious; thereby giving designers the opportunity to first explore the design space and then select the best one or two concepts among a reasonable number of alternatives. Alternative attachment concept generation starts with identification of the basic without or Attachment geometry or representative shape has a significant impact on the full exploration of the design space due to the fact that the assembly procedure and alternative attachment features are dependent thereupon. The task at this step is to generate alternative representative shapes for the part to be attached in the assembly. In order to consider all possibilities for attachment geometry, the designer first needs to identify the final arrangement of parts in the assembly, then decide upon the most appropriate representative shape for each part within a classification scheme. To be thorough, the designer should visit every possible representative shape in the classification scheme; inspecting the parts to be assembled to see if they can actually be assembled based on their geometry. Besides changing the essential geometry or representative shape of parts comprising an assembly, it is also possible to alter details of the interface between the same combination of representative shapes. surfaces on the parts. For Part 2, a cavity shape can be generated for the hand-set by adding an extended wall. These representative shapes are illustrated by thick lines in the figure. Although more alternatives could be generated, these few illustrate the idea underlying the method. Fig. 3 Gencs hierarchical classification scheme of representative shapes GLYPHlt;132gt; from Genc, et al., 1997a GLYPHlt;133gt; Step 2: Identification of Part Combinations. Having generated alternative geometry for each part in the assembly, the next task is to think about possible combinations of these alternatives. This can and, currently, must be accomplished by inspection. If the geometry allows one part to be attached to another, this particular combination is considered an acceptable alternative. There are some combinations which are not possible. This process is continued until all combinations for the particular parts have been considered. Identification of possible combinations has as its goal to further define and refine the boundaries of the design space for a particular application. The identification process is aided by using the matrix of possible part combinations presented by Genc, et al.  4  shown in Fig. 6 a . The outcome of the task will all be possible part combinations that allow engagement based on their geometry. Once this task has been applied for representative shapes generated, as shown in Fig. 6 b for this example, possible combinations are identified as surface-surface, solid-cavity, and surface for mating and base parts, respectively. A surface-cavity The idea of generating alternative representative shapes for an assembly is illustrated in Fig. 4 where the assembly consists of a speaker and a phone hand-set cover. Two attachment concepts are presented. In Fig. 5, by using the classification scheme, two alternative representative shapes are generated for each component of the assembly. For Part 1, surface  hand-set  and solid  speaker  representative shapes are generated by changing the attachment Fig. 4 Examples of generating alternative representative shapes for parts to be attached in an assembly. These parts shown are a speaker and cover for a phone hand-set. Fig. 5 Alternative representative shapes generated for example parts by using Gencs classification scheme GLYPHlt;132gt; Genc, et al., 1997a GLYPHlt;133gt; Fig. 6 Identification of possible part combinations and assembly procedures combination is not considered because, in such a case, extended attachment features need to protrude from the speaker to engage features placed on the inner surfaces of the cavity. Since features cannot be added to the outer surface of the speaker  as a design constraint  , this combination cannot be considered here. Step 3: Identification of Assembly Procedure. Once alternative representative shape combinations have been identified, the designer must think about how to bring actual parts which leads to an assembly procedure. An assembly procedure should be selected in this step because it is important for both dealing with ease of assembly  i.e., DFA  issues and for attachment feature selection and placement. feature A general assembly procedure includes all of the information necessary to describe the way all mating parts must be moved to properly assemble with base parts, including both geometric and sequential information. As such, the assembly procedure consists of several important types of information. The first is information on translation directions in a Cartesian coordinate system required to move each mating part into proximity with the base part to allow engagement. Such motion is called installation direction  2  . A second type of information tells how each mating part must be moved to complete engagement and lock with the mating part. Here, one or more translations andor one or more rotations may be required to be executed in a very specific order. These are called assembly motions  2,4  . A particular part combination can be attached by utilizing any of several different assembly procedures  e.g., a translational push motion or a rotational tip motion, etc.  . The designer should inspect the part geometry and identify applicable installation directions and applicable assembly tions. Possible assembly procedure alternatives for solid-surface combinations pertinent to this example are shown in Fig. 6 c . together, At this stage of the design process, a locking feature selection approach  19,16  is used. According to the approach, once available surface pairs for feature placement are identified, the designer can select alternative locking features compatible with the surface pair geometry as well as with the assembly procedure, which involves the relative movement of surface pairs. In order to select all alternative locking feature pairs, a matrix of possible locking feature pairs is used  19,16  . A locking feature consists of a flexible latch and a rigid catch pair. At this step, the designer should identify catch alternatives that can be formed on one placement surface, and select a corresponding possible latch from the matrix. As a subsequent process after identifying alternative locking features, design objective issues such as ease of manufacture, robustness, load-carrying capability, ease of assembly, can also be taken into account, and candidates can be identified. moIn order to illustrate the process of identification of alternative locking features, one of the example part combinations, the solidsurface combination with a push assembly motion in z -direction shown in Fig. 6, will be used here. First, an appropriate feature placement location is selected, and a relevant assembly procedure is identified. These parts are characterized by a lap type surface pair  or engaging surfaces  with a push assembly motion. It should be noted that the speaker is obtained from a vendor, therefore, geometric modification on it is not possible, resulting in a geometric constraint, and only the edge of the speaker can be used as a catch feature for attachment. For an edge catch feature, alternative latch pairs are identified by using the matrix of locking feature pairs. Although there are five alternative latches, three are compatible with the applicable engaging surfaces and push assembly motion. These candidate locking feature pairs are cantilever hook-edge, trap-edge, and compressive hook-edge pairs. The steps for identifying locking feature alternatives are shown in Fig. 7. Step 4: Identification and Selection of Locking Features. Step 5: Part Constraint. The next step is to constrain unconstrained degrees of freedoms  DOFs  in the assembly. Due to the geometry of parts, some DOFs are constrained naturally by surfaces or walls of the components of an assembly. Remaining DOFs must be constrained by locking and locating features; with the latter being preferred for this function. A procedure based on a part mating matrix is presented in Luscher  20  and Luscher, et al.  21  . This procedure also aims to find a fully constrained design starting with choosing locator features then locks. The procedure described here starts with 1  finding a basis design by considering locking features first, then 2  generating alternative designs from the basis design. This is described below. Step 5.1: Obtaining a Basis Design. Once parts are kinematically constrained, a basis design emerges for a particular part Having identified the overall geometry of parts and the assembly procedure, the designer must next think about actual attachment features to constrain parts. Part geometry provides all information about interacting surfaces. This helps identify potential feature placement surfaces. At this point, the designer should consider all issues that might have impact on this decision, such as appearance, accessibility for disengagement, dimensional variations arising from manufacturing, service loads. etc., and select alternative feature placement surface pairs accordingly. In this manner, studies by Genc, et al.  18,19  identified issues to be considered during attachment  locking or snap-fit  feature selection. Attachment features include constraining  i.e., locking and locating  features, and enhancement features. Being at the same time both the most strategic and yet weakest portion of the attachment, locking features are selected first. Fig. 7 Identification of alternative locking feature pairs geometry and assembly procedure. A basis design is one which is fully constrained kinematically but not necessarily structurally. By kinematically, it is meant that the attachment cannot necessarily carry service loads in a certain direction, but part movement is prevented or constrained. The step of obtaining a basis design is key to generating a structurally sound attachment. The two sub-steps for obtaining a basis design are: i) Constraining the retention and the installation directions . After selecting a locking feature form to hold a mating part in contact with a base part  i.e., provide retention  , the designer has to make sure that the retention direction is fully constrained. To find the minimum number of locking features required to fully constrain the retention direction, a central load is applied in the retention direction  i.e., opposite the installation direction  . It is seen for the example in Fig. 8 a that a force couple arises from such loading. To balance this force couple, another locking feature needs to be placed opposite the first one. After placing the second locking feature, the retention direction is fully constrained. Fig. 8 b shows the details of constraining the retention direction. constrained are inherently more robust than locking features, which must be able to elastically deflect to function  to produce a sound attachment. To determine where locating features must be placed to provide further constraint, a central load is first applied in the positive x -direction. To react this load, a locating feature, e.g., a stop, is placed opposite the applied load as shown in Fig. 8 c . It can be seen that, even with this locator, the mating part is still not constrained in the negative x -direction if a central load is applied in that direction. Another locating feature is thus needed to constrain this direction. Once these locators are placed, parts of the assembly are fully constrained, resulting in a basis design. This is shown in Fig. 8 d . The next task is to check the installation direction whether it is constrained or not. As seen for this example, it has already been constrained naturally by the base part. Now, other directions need to be inspected and constrained. ii) Constraining remaining directions . By inspection of the example in Fig. 8 b , it is seen that the mating part is not yet constrained in either positive or negative x -directions. Motion in the y -direction is constrained, at least kinematically, by the locking features used to cause retention. All remaining unconstrained directions are preferably constrained by locating features  as these to see Step 5.2: Generating Alternative Attachment Concepts. At this point in the design process  after obtaining a basis design  , the designer should use locking feature and locating feature alternatives as well as enhancement features to generate alternative attachment concepts. Here, attachment feature form, as well as their number, location, and orientation can be changed to enhance loadcarrying capability, ease of manufacture, or ease of assembly to come up with different attachment options. Alternatives are, in general, generated by enhancing the attachment for certain pertinent loading cases. For instance, if parts are to be loaded in the retention direction  which, because of the inherent character of most locking features, is constrained for only limited loads  , attachment can be enhanced by adding more locking features or using an alternative locking feature with an inherently higher ret ntion force capability. If the attachment is expected to experience critical loads in in-plane directions, i.e., x - and y -directions, Fig. 8 Part constraining process to obtain a basis design Alternative Attachment Concepts. (generated by changing the basis design) et al.  22  . In this step, that tool will be used to evaluate alternative attachment concepts generated in preceding Step 5 to select the best concept for the application. by For the example being used here, the design problem has multiple objectives; i.e., high structural performance, low manufacturing cost, and low assembly cost. Worksheets  22  can be used to quantitatively compare design alternatives. As suggested Bonenberger  2  , locking features tend to be weaker than locating features. Therefore, a measure of the weakness of a design can be formulated by counting DOFs constrained by locking features. Evaluation of alternatives based on manufacturing cost identifies the relative manufacturing cost penalty for alternative concepts. Evaluation based on assembly cost also compares alternatives based on the time required to bring parts together for final engagement. The procedure for determining structural performance value, manufacturing cost, and assembly cost will be illustrated, looking at each objective separately. Fig. 9 Enhanced attachment concepts Step 6.1: Determining Structural Performance Value. The tool presented in this paper for determining a structural performance value  or relative index  is simple, albeit not as rigorous as might ultimately be desired. But, it is good enough to allow quick evaluation of alternatives to aid in selecting best options within a sub-set. In order to conduct a more detailed evaluation of alternative attachment concepts from the structural performance point of view, more research is needed. Among other things, specific snap-fit features  e.g., cantilever hooks vs. compressive traps, and even cantilever hooks with different beam length-to-width and depth ratios, hook retention angles, etc.  must be studied and characterized for their relative performance for different loading directions, loading characteristics, and applications. Such a study is tedious, and the outcome is of questionable value as relative performance  versus absolute performance  may be sufficient for the purpose. then, adding more locating features or adding a continuous locating feature will improve the strength of the attachment in these directions. The goal here is structural constraint as opposed to just kinematic constraint against service loads. Three alternative attachment concepts  Concepts A, B, and C  generated using the basis design example in Fig. 8 are shown in Fig. 9. Since the three locking feature alternatives shown  i.e., cantilever hook, trap, or compressive hook  can be applied to these three enhanced designs, there are nine  3 3 3  attachment concept alternatives for a solid-surface part combination employing a push assembly motion. Once variation in part geometry and assembly procedure as well as attachment features have been considered, it is seen that a reasonable number of attachment concepts can be generated. This outcome allows the designer to search the entire design space to select the best attachment concept. For the purposes of this method, as mentioned above, structural performance value is determined by counting the DOFs constrained by the minimum number of locking features needed to achieve attachment in the basis design. This task is accomplished by visual inspection. The designer must check every translation and rotation direction or degree of freedom, and identify the constraining feature type for each; counting directions constrained by locking features  as these are weaker than locating features  . This total number results in a measure of weakness, with 12 being weakest  i.e., no locating, only locking features  and 1 being strongest  i.e., only one locking feature, which is the minimum possible to have an assembly  . During this process, the worksheet proposed by Genc, et al.  22  is used. Step 6: Evaluation of and Selection among Attachment Concepts. In this step, alternatives generated as described above are evaluated and the best design is selected as the last step of the conceptual design stage. At first, each concept needs to be evaluated for an individual design objective. Then, multiple objectives can and should be considered. There is always a trade-off among objectives when the design has multiple objectives. The designer should, therefore, identify design goals, and prioritize them with either a weighting coefficient or a rating system. By visually inspecting the concepts in Fig. 10, Concept B is seen to have seven degrees of freedom constrained by locking features in Fig. 10. These degrees of freedoms are shown with arrows in Fig. 10. If the structural performance worksheet is used to record the relatively weak directions constrained by locking features, results appear as in the table in Fig. 10. In this table, weak directions are checked. The total number of checked directions represents the weakness of the attachment concept, here 7. Obviously, if structural performance is a critical design objective, a concept with a lower number of weaknesses would be preferred due to the fact that relatively few degrees of freedom are constrained by locking features. In integral attachment design, important design objectives are categorized into three fundamental categories:  1  structural performance;  2  ease of manufacture; and  3  ease of assembly. Other issues such as aesthetics, robustness, reliability, safety, vibration and noise, etc., can also be included in the evaluation process to eliminate unacceptable or non-optimal designs. quantitative evaluation tool to be used for integral attachment concept selection has been developed and presented by A Genc, Step 6.2: Determining Manufacturing Cost. Evaluation based on manufacturing cost has been presented by Genc, et al.  22  based on a study by Dixon and Poli  11  . The proposed cost analysis approach focuses on and evaluates attachment strategies rather than the entire part or assembly as Dixon and Poli did. The evaluation process includes three different components:  1  basic complexity;  2  subsidiary complexity due to mold cavity detail;   Translational degrees of freedom  Translational degrees of freedom  Translational degrees of freedom  Translational degrees of freedom  Translational degrees of freedom  Rotational degrees of freedom  Rotational degrees of freedom  Rotational degrees of freedom  Rotational degrees of freedom  Rotational degrees of freedom  Rotational degrees of freedom  Total (checked)    Concepts  Tx  -Tx  Ty  -Ty  Iz  Rx  -Rx  Ry  Ry  Rz  -Rz  Total (checked)   Concept A               Concept B              Fig. 10 Structural performance value for the example attachment concepts and  3  basic cycle time. The first two affect tooling cost, 3 while the third affects the processing or equipment operating cost. In order to determine tooling cost due to basic part complexity, the following factors need to be identified:  1  number of external undercuts;  2  number of internal undercuts; and  3  dividing surface information. The example alternative concept shown in Fig. 11 a will be used to illustrate the determination of the basic complexity penalty cost. for a rib-like feature is 3. The total penalty is 12  4  rib-like features  3 3  penalty per feature  . This total penalty corresponds to moderate cavity detail for small parts. The total subsidiary penalty of 1.25 can be found by using the subsidiary rating table developed by Dixon and Poli. only Having determined the tooling cost penalty, the processing cost must be determined. To do this, the part needs to be inspected to see whether it is a slender partitionable part, a non-slender partitionable part, or a non-partitionable part  as differentiated by Dixo and Poli  . It is seen that both alternatives are non-slender partitionable parts. Next, features must be inspected to identify if any would be considered significant against certain criteria in the method of Dixon and Poli. It is seen that locking features in Concept B are significant for having a height at least three times greater than the wall thickness. In Concept B, feature thickness is less than the wall thickness of 2.5 mm, and the features are not supported by gusset plates; considered two other significant factors. By using this information, the processing cost penalty can be found as 3.24 for Concept B. Finally, the total manufacturing cost penalty for the two attachment concepts can be determined by using tooling cost due to basic part complexity ( C b ) and subsidiary complexity ( C s ) and processing cost ( C e ). The total cost is given as a function of these cost penalties as follows. As seen in Fig. 11 a , there are two undercuts in Concept B to be dealt with. Recall, the bottom surface of the part cannot be penetrated for aesthetic reasons. Therefore, a side-action device needs to be used in a mold to manufacture the hand-set cover for the mold closure direction shown. In its basic form, Concept B has a box-like shape, one internal undercut  in fact two, but since they can be dealt with a single side-action mechanism, it is counted as one  , no external undercut, and a non-planar dividing surface due to the overall part geometry, which is non-planar  see Genc, et al.,  22  , or Dixon and Poli,  11  . With this information, a corresponding cost penalty can be identified using the basic complexity cost analysis table presented by Genc, et al.  22  . The resulting cost penalty is 3.73. Next, the cost penalty due to subsidiary complexity needs to be determined. For this, the type and number of features must be identified. Concept B has four rib-like features according to Dixon and Poli  11  . Part size is less than 250 mm, which is considered a small part. Finally, when cavity detail is considered, the penalty Thus then, the penalty for each concept is: 3 Since, at this time, most parts assembled using integral snap-fits are composed of plastic and produced by thermal molding  e.g., injection molding  , tooling cost refers to the cost of molds.
